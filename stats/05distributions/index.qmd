## Five distributions
We previously looked at the normal distribution. In this
Chapter of our textbook, @Diez2019, we visit five distributions:

- Normal distribution
- Geometric distribution
- Binomial distribution
- Negative binomial distribution
- Poisson distribution

## Normal distribution
The mound-shaped curve represents the probability density
function and the area between the curve and the horizontal
line represents the value of the cumulative distribution
function.

## Normally distributed nationwide test

The total shaded area between the curve and the straight
horizontal line can be thought of as one hundred percent
of that area. In the world of probability, we measure that
area as 1. The curve is symmetrical, so measure all the
area to the left of the highest point on the curve as 0.5.
That is half, or fifty percent, of the total area between
the curve and the horizontal line at the bottom. Instead
of saying *area between the curve and the horizontal
line at the bottom*, people usually say *the area
under the curve*.

## Probability density function

For any value along the $x$-axis, the $y$-value on the
curve represents the value of the probability density
function.

The area bounded by the vertical line between the $x$-axis
and the corresponding $y$-value on the curve, though, is
what we are usually interested in because that area
represents probability.

## Notation

$N(\mu,\sigma)$ is said to characterize a normal
distribution. If we know the *parameters* $\mu$, the mean,
and $\sigma$, the standard deviation, we have a complete
picture of the normal distribution, namely the height of
the hump and its width. Note that some texts will say $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ and leave you to figure out which is meant. In our case, we'll follow the R convention, described next.

## R function to find probability
The `pnorm()` function takes a value of a normally distributed
random variable and returns the probability of that
value or less. The textbook gives an example of the SAT
and ACT scores. For the SAT, the textbook claims that $\mu = 1100$ and
$\sigma=200$ so we can say the SAT score $x\sim
N(1100,200)$ which is read as "x has the normal
distribution with mean 1100 and standard deviation 200."

## An easy example
Suppose you score 1100. What is the probability that
someone will score lower than you?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
pnorm(1100,mean=1100,sd=200)
```

This returns a value of 0.5 or fifty percent. That's
something we can tell without a computer, but for the
normal distribution, other values are difficult to
compute by hand or guess correctly.

## An example requiring a computer

```{r, echo=TRUE}
pnorm(1400,mean=1100,sd=200)
```

returns a value of 0.9331928, or that 93 percent of
students get below this score.

Because all probabilities sum to 1, we can use this
information to tell the probability of someone getting a
higher score, or the probability of getting a score
between two scores by subtracting the smaller from the
larger.

## Another textbook example
The textbook gives another example as finding the
probability that a particular student scores at least
1190:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
1 - pnorm(1190,mean=1100,sd=200)
```

which returns 32.64 percent.

## *Z*-scores
Note that we did not
explicitly calculate the $Z$-score that leads to the previous
probability. The $Z$-score is a way of standardizing so
that instead of (in this case) $x\sim N(1100,200)$, we
calculate the probability of $Z\sim N(0,1)$. Here, we
standardize by recognizing that $Z=(x-\mu)/\sigma$ or
$(1190-1100)/200=0.45$ and then we can say

```{r, echo=TRUE}
1 - pnorm(0.45,mean=0,sd=1)
```

and we get the same answer as above, 32.64 percent.

## Geometric distribution
First we need Bernoulli random variables to understand
the Geometric distribution.

If $X$ is a random variable that takes value 1 with
probability of success $p$ and $0$ with probability
$1 − p$, then $X$ is a Bernoulli random variable with
mean and standard deviation $\mu=p$ and
$\sigma=\sqrt{p(1-p)}$. A Bernoulli random variable is a
process with only two outcomes: success or failure.
Flipping a coin and calling it is an example of
Bernoulli random variable.

## Purpose of the geometric distribution
Now the question is "What happens if you flip a coin or
roll the dice or some other win/lose process many times
in a row?"

The geometric distribution describes how many times it
takes to obtain success in a series of Bernoulli trials.

## Geometric distribution example
The textbook (p. 145) gives an example where an
insurance company employee is looking for the first
person to meet a criteria where the probability of
meeting that criteria is 0.7 or seventy percent. We can
calculate the probability of 0 failures (the first
person, one failure (the second person), and so on.

## Using R for the example

```{r, echo=TRUE}
(a <- dgeom(x=0,prob=0.7)) # the first person
(b <- dgeom(x=1,prob=0.7)) # the second person
(c <- dgeom(x=2,prob=0.7)) # the third person
(d <- dgeom(x=3,prob=0.7)) # the fourth person
(e <- dgeom(x=4,prob=0.7)) # the fifth person
```

## Graphing the results
if we graph these numbers, we'll find they have the
property of exponential decay.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
x<-c(a,b,c,d,e)
plot(x)
```

## Textbook definition of the geometric distribution

If the probability of a success in one trial is $p$ and
the probability of a failure is $1 − p$, then the
probability of finding the first success in the $n$th
trial is given by $(1 − p)^{n−1}p$. The mean (i.e. expected
value) and standard deviation of this wait
time are given by $μ = 1/p$, $σ = \sqrt{(1 − p)/p^2}$.

## Binomial distribution
The textbook says that the binomial distribution is used to describe the number
of successes in a fixed number of trials. This is
different from the geometric distribution, which
described the number of trials we must wait before we
observe a success.

## Binomial theorem
Suppose the probability of a single trial being a
success is $p$. Then the probability of observing exactly
$k$ successes in $n$ independent trials is given by

$$
\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}
$$

and $\mu=np$, $\sigma=\sqrt{np(1-p)}$

## Example using R

The website [r-tutor.com](https://www.r-tutor.com/elementary-statistics/probability-distributions/binomial-distribution) gives the following problem
as an example:

#### Problem

Suppose there are twelve multiple choice questions in an
English class quiz. Each question has five possible
answers, and only one of them is correct. Find the
probability of having four or fewer correct answers if a student attempts to answer every question at random.

## Solution

Since only one out of five possible answers is correct, the probability of answering a question correctly by random is 1/5=0.2. We can find the probability of having exactly 4 correct answers by random attempts as follows.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
dbinom(4, size=12, prob=0.2)
```

which returns 0.1329.

To find the probability of having four or less correct
answers by random attempts, we apply the function dbinom
with $x = 0,\ldots,4$.

## Using R

```{r, echo=TRUE}
dbinom(0, size=12, prob=0.2) +
dbinom(1, size=12, prob=0.2) +
dbinom(2, size=12, prob=0.2) +
dbinom(3, size=12, prob=0.2) +
dbinom(4, size=12, prob=0.2)
```

which returns 0.9274.

## A different way
Alternatively, we can use the cumulative probability function for binomial distribution pbinom.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
pbinom(4, size=12, prob=0.2)
```

which returns the same answer.

## Answer

The probability of four or fewer questions answered correctly by random in a twelve question multiple choice quiz is 92.7%.

## Negative binomial distribution
This is a generalization of the geometric distribution,
defined in the textbook as follows.

The negative binomial distribution describes the probability of observing the $k$th success on the
$n$th trial, where all trials are independent:

$$
P (\text{the kth success on the nth trial}) =
\binom{n − 1}{k − 1} p^k(1 − p)^{n−k}
$$

The value $p$ represents the probability that an
individual trial is a success.

## Poisson distribution
The textbook defines the Poisson distribution as
follows.

Suppose we are watching for events and the number of
observed events follows a Poisson distribution with
rate $λ$. Then

$$
P (\text{observe k events}) = \frac{λ^ke^{−λ}}{k!}
$$

where $k$
may take a value 0, 1, 2, and so on, and $k!$ represents
$k$-factorial, as described on page 150. The letter e ≈
2.718 is the base of the natural logarithm. The mean and
standard deviation of this distribution are λ and √λ,
respectively.

## R-tutor example for the Poisson distribution
The r-tutor website mentioned above offers the following
example of a Poisson distribution problem solved using R.

#### Problem

If there are twelve cars crossing a bridge per minute on average, find the probability of having seventeen or more cars crossing the bridge in a particular minute.

## Solution

The probability of having sixteen or fewer cars crossing the bridge in a particular minute is given by the function ppois.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ppois(16, lambda=12)   # lower tail
```

which returns 0.89871

Hence the probability of having seventeen or more cars crossing the bridge in a minute is in the upper tail of the probability density function.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ppois(16, lambda=12, lower=FALSE)   # upper tail
```

which returns 0.10129

## Answer in words

If there are twelve cars crossing a bridge per minute on average, the probability of having seventeen or more cars crossing the bridge in a particular minute is 10.1%.
