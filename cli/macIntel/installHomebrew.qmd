## Install Homebrew

For this you will use the terminal. You can find the macOS default terminal by opening the Finder and navigating to `/Applications/Utilities`. There are many useful programs in that folder, arranged alphabetically. Navigate to Terminal.app and double click it.

Enter the following commands in the terminal. You should be able to copy and paste them from this list to avoid transcription errors.

Note that everything from a hashmark (#) to the end of the line is regarded as a comment and is not processed. I just include those comments for your information.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
eval $(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)
brew install bash # the shell that will process all your cli commands
sudo pico /etc/shells # add /usr/local/bin/bash to the list in that file
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash # makes bash the default shell
brew install quicksilver # simplifies opening programs
brew install iterm2 # terminal replacement; when our setup is complete we will use it instead of terminal
brew install hammerspoon # controls window placement on screen
```
