## Install Firefox
  Then add tree style tabs under Tools > Add-ons and Themes.

## Configure Firefox
Notice that in the following list of instructions, you have to substitute your current profile where it says `<current profile>`. This isn't always easy since Firefox (in my experience) installs two profiles and you have to figure out which is actually yours. In my case, it is the one with the suffix `.default-release`. It has a vast number of files in it, as opposed to the single file in the other one.

- Get userChrome.css from Canvas > Files > misc
- Add userChrome.css to `~/Library/Application\ Support/Firefox/Profiles/<current profile>/chrome/`
- go to about:config and toggle the following setting to true:
 `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`

The point of all this is to maximize vertical space available in Firefox windows. It puts the tabs into a tree on the left side of the window and takes away a bunch of the stuff at the top of the window.
