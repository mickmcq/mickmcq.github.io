## Transfer dotfiles

If you are switching to a new machine, you may want to keep your old dotfiles, so that you get expected behaviors. If you don't know what a dotfile is, you can skip this step and later look at the dotfiles module.

### step 1 of 2 to transfer dotfiles:
Attach usb drive to old machine. Note that you must substitute the name of your usb drive below where it says `<name of usb drive>`. When you attach the usb drive to the machine, the usb drive's name will appear in Finder under the Locations section.

```bash
/usr/local/bin/rsync -PUpavh ~/.??* /Volumes/<name of usb drive>
```

### step 2 of 2 to transfer dotfiles:
attach usb drive to new machine

```bash
cd /Volumes/<name of usb drive>
/usr/local/bin/rsync -PUpavh ~/.??* ~/
```
