## Install texlive (takes hours!)
Use the instructions at [https://tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html](https://tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html) and the file called `install-tl-unx.tar.gz`.

The instructions at the time of this writing include the following. Note that the string `20230723` will differ based on the date of the version you've downloaded.

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
tar xvzf install-tl-unx.tar.gz
cd install-tl-20230723
./install-tl
```

After you are finished (hours later), if you are moving from an old machine that had texlive installed, use rsync to get texmf-local from your old machine to your new machine, e.g., for my machine on a local network, I say:

```bash
rsync -PUpavh /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/ mcq@technicals-mbp.lan:"/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/"
```
