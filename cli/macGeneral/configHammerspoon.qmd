## Configure hammerspoon
Hammerspoon is a general purpose tool, but I just use it to control window placement. The window positions are as follows.

I hold down the Option and Command keys with my left thumb and the control key (formerly the caps-lock key) with my left pinky. Then, with my right forefinger, I press any of the following keys to move the current window into the desired position:

- j --- lower half of the display
- k --- upper half of the display
- h --- left half of the display
- l --- right half of the display
- m --- maximize the window
- 1 --- upper left quadrant
- 2 --- upper right quadrant
- 3 --- lower left quadrant
- 4 --- lower right quadrant

```bash
ls ~/.hammerspoon
#. if you get an error message, say:
mkdir ~/.hammerspoon
#. get the init.lua file from Canvas > Files > misc
cp -p init.lua ~/.hammerspoon/
```
