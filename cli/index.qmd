# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is stage one of the *Welcome to the command line* project. This stage includes three things:

- individual modules of command line interface (cli) instruction written in vanilla Markdown
- a searchable Quarto wrapper around the modules (this book) for easy navigation
- a set of Youtube videos corresponding to the modules

Stage two is called *conpackverse* and involves three things:

- a GitHub organization called *conpackverse* to develop this set of modules further
- a GitHub repo of the modules, allowing modules to be added or refined
- a Python packaging of the modules to allow an instructor to choose only the modules required for a particular course.

This is a Quarto book. To learn more about Quarto books visit <https://quarto.org/docs/books>.
For now, it's enough to know that each chapter represents a module, except for the macSetup chapters, which are collections of modules.
