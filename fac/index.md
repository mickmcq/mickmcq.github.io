# Agenda

- What is the FAC?
- Why should iSchool faculty care?
- What the FAC did this year

# What is the FAC?

## Mandate (Policy B2.0)
<small>
The Faculty Affairs Committee shall be responsible for policy recommendations concerning faculty tenure, rank, welfare, leave, and professional conduct and shall review all policies and procedures concerning the extended part-time and adjunct faculty of the university.  The committee will also oversee the needs related to the professional development of quality teaching and serve to foster collegiality and mentorship among faculty. The Faculty Affairs Committee shall consist of the following: one faculty member per college, each to be elected by their collegial faculty; one dean elected by the Deans Council; three members at large elected by the Faculty Senate; and the provost or their delegate (ex-officio, voting).
</small>

## Informal version of above

- Receive charges from the Faculty Senate
- Make recommendations on those charges periodically
- Write a report at the end of the year to the Senate

## Membership

- Fifteen members, including one GCCIS representative (me) and three-at-large members (currently including one GCCIS faculty: Cathy Beaton)
- Two co-chairs (currently, but at least one is stepping down) M. Ann Howard and Stacey Davis
- Three members are current senators

# Why care?
- Outside of GCCIS, GCCIS is widely perceived as CS
- Faculty senate has two IGM members, no iSchool members
- Policies affect us, with little understanding of our needs
- Non-tenure track faculty, especially, are poorly represented on Senate

# What the FAC did this year, charge by charge

(By the way, the complete charge details are available via googling!)

## Governance Framework

Develop, in consultation with college constituents, a general governance
framework for the colleges that is consistent in its fundamental principles
across all colleges, to be approved by the Senate and ratified by each college.
...

## Outcome

Recommended changes *may* have been voted on by Senate May 5th. Senate April 28th meeting featured lively discussion of *too many meetings*.

## Faculty Grievance Policy

Complete the revision to the Faculty Grievance Policy (E24.0) begun last year
and bring the revision to Senate for a vote.

## Outcome

Sennate approved all our recommended changes (mostly trying to make the process more fair to the grievant) on April 21st.

## POW replacement

Consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of eliminating the formal Plan of
Work (POW) and replacing it with a brief document that states goals for a
faculty member over a 3--5 year period.
...

## Outcome

Everyone on FAC wants to eliminate the POW, but the FAC urges the replacement policy to be included as a charge for next year, largely because different units have different needs. All were agreed that it should be a 3--5 year plan document on teaching, scholarship, and service.

## Life Circumstances in annual review

Evaluate the need for creating a process for dealing with significant life
events that impact professional progress such as including a permanent “Life
Circumstances” portion of the annual review for faculty. ...

## Outcome

FAC recommended an optional statement for the annual review document, and noted the problems presented by changes in the NY State policy on Paid Family Leave.

## Allocation of Senate Representation

Conduct a peer institution investigation (and gather other relevant data as
needed) to see how other research universities of similar size that have
faculty senates allocate representation, as in how the number of faculty per
college affects the number of senators per college, whether it is a sliding or
absolute scale, etc. ...

## Outcome

FAC conducted a review of peer institutions and came up with no substantial data. FAC suggested that Faculty Senate conduct an evaluation of its decision-making process.

## Allocation of Senate Representation redux

Examine B.02-5.2 in order to assess possible conflicts within the policy
language (as noted here), and whether the last phrase is entirely necessary. ...

## Outcome

No changes recommended.

## Senior and Principal Lecturer Promotion

Prepare and bring to Senate a revision to E.06 (Faculty Rank and Promotion)
that clarifies that the contract terms for Senior Lecturer and Principal
Lecturer are granted permanently and not treated as a temporary promotion.

## Outcome

FAC modified the language to clarify and I believe Senate passed this although I can't find a date.

## Non tenure track Ranks

Evaluate the need for a change of rank structure for Lecturers, Senior
Lecturers, and Principal lectures (e.g., do we have the right number of ranks,
are the titles the best ones available, are the periods of appointment
sufficiently long), and report to Senate with recommendations as appropriate.

## Outcome

FAC recommended changes, which one senator tried to table. Tabling, for those unfamiliar with Robert's Rules of Order, doesn't really mean "discuss later", which is the common understanding of the term, but instead means to bury it unless advocates can muster the votes to bring it "off the table." Senate held three separate discussions and then sent it back to FAC for "more research" even though FAC had conducted extensive research and also because some senators did not have a chance to poll their constituents.

# Summary

- FAC needs you, especially if you're non tenure track
- Faculty Senate needs you too, although I'm seeing it as dysfunctional from the outside
- FAC is a great committee for thoughtful deliberations and making articulate recommendations
