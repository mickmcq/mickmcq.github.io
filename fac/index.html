<h1>What is the FAC?</h1>

</section>
<section id="mandate-policy-b2.0" class="slide level2">
<h2>Mandate (Policy B2.0)</h2>
<p><small> The Faculty Affairs Committee shall be responsible for policy
recommendations concerning faculty tenure, rank, welfare, leave, and
professional conduct and shall review all policies and procedures
concerning the extended part-time and adjunct faculty of the university.
The committee will also oversee the needs related to the professional
development of quality teaching and serve to foster collegiality and
mentorship among faculty. The Faculty Affairs Committee shall consist of
the following: one faculty member per college, each to be elected by
their collegial faculty; one dean elected by the Deans Council; three
members at large elected by the Faculty Senate; and the provost or their
delegate (ex-officio, voting). </small></p>
</section>
<section id="informal-version-of-above" class="slide level2">
<h2>Informal version of above</h2>
<ul>
<li>Receive charges from the Faculty Senate</li>
<li>Make recommendations on those charges periodically</li>
<li>Write a report at the end of the year to the Senate</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="membership" class="slide level2">
<h2>Membership</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fifteen members, including one GCCIS representative (me) and
three-at-large members (currently including one GCCIS faculty: Cathy
Beaton)</li>
<li>Two co-chairs (currently, but at least one is stepping down) M. Ann
Howard and Stacey Davis</li>
<li>Three members are current senators</li>
</ul>
</section></section>
<section id="why-care" class="title-slide slide level1">
<h1>Why care?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Outside of GCCIS, GCCIS is widely perceived as CS</li>
<li>Faculty senate has two IGM members, no iSchool members</li>
<li>Policies affect us, with little understanding of our needs</li>
<li>Non-tenure track faculty, especially, are poorly represented on
Senate</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<section id="what-the-fac-did-this-year-charge-by-charge"
class="title-slide slide level1">
<h1>What the FAC did this year, charge by charge</h1>
<p>(By the way, the complete charge details are available via
googling!)</p>
</section>
<section id="governance-framework" class="slide level2">
<h2>Governance Framework</h2>
<p>Develop, in consultation with college constituents, a general
governance framework for the colleges that is consistent in its
fundamental principles across all colleges, to be approved by the Senate
and ratified by each college. …</p>
</section>
<section id="outcome" class="slide level2">
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>Recommended changes <em>may</em> have been voted on by Senate May
5th. Senate April 28th meeting featured lively discussion of <em>too
many meetings</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="faculty-grievance-policy" class="slide level2">
<h2>Faculty Grievance Policy</h2>
<p>Complete the revision to the Faculty Grievance Policy (E24.0) begun
last year and bring the revision to Senate for a vote.</p>
</section>
<section id="outcome-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>Sennate approved all our recommended changes (mostly trying to make
the process more fair to the grievant) on April 21st.</p>
</section>
<section id="pow-replacement" class="slide level2">
<h2>POW replacement</h2>
<p>Consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of eliminating the
formal Plan of Work (POW) and replacing it with a brief document that
states goals for a faculty member over a 3–5 year period. …</p>
</section>
<section id="outcome-2" class="slide level2">
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>Everyone on FAC wants to eliminate the POW, but the FAC urges the
replacement policy to be included as a charge for next year, largely
because different units have different needs. All were agreed that it
should be a 3–5 year plan document on teaching, scholarship, and
service.</p>
</section>
<section id="life-circumstances-in-annual-review" class="slide level2">
<h2>Life Circumstances in annual review</h2>
<p>Evaluate the need for creating a process for dealing with significant
life events that impact professional progress such as including a
permanent “Life Circumstances” portion of the annual review for faculty.
…</p>
</section>
<section id="outcome-3" class="slide level2">
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>FAC recommended an optional statement for the annual review document,
and noted the problems presented by changes in the NY State policy on
Paid Family Leave.</p>
</section>
<section id="allocation-of-senate-representation" class="slide level2">
<h2>Allocation of Senate Representation</h2>
<p>Conduct a peer institution investigation (and gather other relevant
data as needed) to see how other research universities of similar size
that have faculty senates allocate representation, as in how the number
of faculty per college affects the number of senators per college,
whether it is a sliding or absolute scale, etc. …</p>
</section>
<section id="outcome-4" class="slide level2">
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>FAC conducted a review of peer institutions and came up with no
substantial data. FAC suggested that Faculty Senate conduct an
evaluation of its decision-making process.</p>
</section>
<section id="allocation-of-senate-representation-redux"
class="slide level2">
<h2>Allocation of Senate Representation redux</h2>
<p>Examine B.02-5.2 in order to assess possible conflicts within the
policy language (as noted here), and whether the last phrase is entirely
necessary. …</p>
</section>
<section id="outcome-5" class="slide level2">
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>No changes recommended.</p>
</section>
<section id="senior-and-principal-lecturer-promotion"
class="slide level2">
<h2>Senior and Principal Lecturer Promotion</h2>
<p>Prepare and bring to Senate a revision to E.06 (Faculty Rank and
Promotion) that clarifies that the contract terms for Senior Lecturer
and Principal Lecturer are granted permanently and not treated as a
temporary promotion.</p>
</section>
<section id="outcome-6" class="slide level2">
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>FAC modified the language to clarify and I believe Senate passed this
although I can’t find a date.</p>
</section>
<section id="non-tenure-track-ranks" class="slide level2">
<h2>Non tenure track Ranks</h2>
<p>Evaluate the need for a change of rank structure for Lecturers,
Senior Lecturers, and Principal lectures (e.g., do we have the right
number of ranks, are the titles the best ones available, are the periods
of appointment sufficiently long), and report to Senate with
recommendations as appropriate.</p>
</section>
<section id="outcome-7" class="slide level2">
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>FAC recommended changes, which one senator tried to table. Tabling,
for those unfamiliar with Robert’s Rules of Order, doesn’t really mean
“discuss later”, which is the common understanding of the term, but
instead means to bury it unless advocates can muster the votes to bring
it “off the table.” Senate held three separate discussions and then sent
it back to FAC for “more research” even though FAC had conducted
extensive research and also because some senators did not have a chance
to poll their constituents.</p>
</section></section>
<section id="summary" class="title-slide slide level1">
<h1>Summary</h1>
<ul>
<li>FAC needs you, especially if you’re non tenure track</li>
<li>Faculty Senate needs you too, although I’m seeing it as
dysfunctional from the outside</li>
<li>FAC is a great committee for thoughtful deliberations and making
articulate recommendations</li>
</ul>
