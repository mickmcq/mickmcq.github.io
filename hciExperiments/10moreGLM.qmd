## Preference between touchpads vs trackballs by non / disabled people and males / females

This study examines whether participants of either sex with or without a disability prefer touchpads or trackballs. Start by examining the data and determining how many participants are involved.

```{r}
dps<-read_csv("deviceprefssex.csv")
dps$Subject<-as.factor(dps$Subject)
dps$Disability<-as.factor(dps$Disability)
dps$Sex<-as.factor(dps$Sex)
dps$Pref<-as.factor(dps$Pref)
summary(dps)
```

Use binomial regression to examine Pref by Disability and Sex. Report the $p$-value of the interaction of Disability$\times$Sex.

```{r}
contrasts(dps$Disability) <- "contr.sum"
contrasts(dps$Sex) <- "contr.sum"
m<-glm(Pref ~ Disability*Sex, data=dps, family=binomial)
Anova(m, type=3)
```

Now use multinomial regression for the same task and report the corresponding $p$-value.

```{r}
#. library(nnet)
contrasts(dps$Disability) <- "contr.sum"
contrasts(dps$Sex) <- "contr.sum"
m<-multinom(Pref~Disability*Sex, data=dps)
Anova(m, type=3)
```

Now conduct post-hoc binomial tests for each Disability$\times$Sex combination.

```{r}
m0<-binom.test(sum(dps[dps$Sex == "M" & dps$Disability == "0",]$Pref == "touchpad"),
               nrow(dps[dps$Sex == "M" & dps$Disability == "0",]),p=1/2)
m1<-binom.test(sum(dps[dps$Sex == "M" & dps$Disability == "1",]$Pref == "touchpad"),
               nrow(dps[dps$Sex == "M" & dps$Disability == "1",]),p=1/2)

f0<-binom.test(sum(dps[dps$Sex == "F" & dps$Disability == "0",]$Pref == "touchpad"),
               nrow(dps[dps$Sex == "F" & dps$Disability == "0",]),p=1/2)
f1<-binom.test(sum(dps[dps$Sex == "F" & dps$Disability == "1",]$Pref == "touchpad"),
               nrow(dps[dps$Sex == "F" & dps$Disability == "1",]),p=1/2)

p.adjust(c(m0$p.value, m1$p.value, f0$p.value,f1$p.value), method="holm")
```

## Handwriting recognition speed between different tools and right-handed vs left-handed people

This study examined three handwriting recognizers, A, B, and C and participants who are either right-handed or left-handed. The response is the number of incorrectly recognized handwritten words out of every 100 handwritten words. Examine the data and tell how many participants were involved.

```{r}
hw<-read_csv("hwreco.csv")
hw$Subject<-factor(hw$Subject)
hw$Recognizer<-factor(hw$Recognizer)
hw$Hand<-factor(hw$Hand)
summary(hw)
```

Create an interaction plot of Recognizer on the $x$-axis and Hand as the traces and tell how many times the traces cross.

```{r}
par(pin=c(2.75,1.25),cex=0.5)
with(hw,interaction.plot(Recognizer,Hand,Errors,
			      ylim=c(0,max(hw$Errors))))
```

Test whether the Errors of each Recognizer fit a Poisson distribution. First fit the Poisson distribution using `fitdist()`, then test the fit using `gofstat()`. The null hypothesis of this test is that the data do not deviate from a Poisson distribution.

```{r}
#. library(fitdistrplus)
fit<-fitdist(hw[hw$Recognizer == "A",]$Errors,
              "pois", discrete=TRUE)
gofstat(fit)
fit<-fitdist(hw[hw$Recognizer == "B",]$Errors,
              "pois", discrete=TRUE)
gofstat(fit)
fit<-fitdist(hw[hw$Recognizer == "C",]$Errors,
              "pois", discrete=TRUE)
gofstat(fit)
```

Now use Poisson regression to examine Errors by Recommender and Hand. Report the $p$-value for the Recognizer$\times$Hand interaction.

```{r}
#. library(car)
contrasts(hw$Recognizer) <- "contr.sum"
contrasts(hw$Hand) <- "contr.sum"
m<-glm(Errors ~ Recognizer*Hand, data=hw, family=poisson)
Anova(m, type=3)
```

Conduct planned comparisons between left and right errors for each recognizer. Using `glht()` and `lsm()` will give all comparisons and we only want three so don't correct for multiple comparisons automatically. That would overcorrect. Instead, extract the three relevant $p$-values manually and and use `p.adjust()` to correct for those.

```{r}
#. library(multcomp) # for glht
#. library(lsmeans) # for lsm
summary(glht(m, lsm(pairwise ~ Recognizer * Hand)),
        test=adjusted(type="none"))

p.adjust(c(0.001925,0.095955,0.243171),method="holm")
```

The above analyses suggest that the error counts were Poisson-distributed.
The above analyses suggest that there was a significant Recognizer$\times$Hand interaction.
The above analyses suggest that for recognizer A, there were significantly more errors for right-handed participants than for left-handed participants.

## Ease of booking international or domestic flights on three different services

This study describes flight bookings using one of three services, Expedia, Orbitz, or Priceline. Each booking was either International or Domestic and the Ease of each interaction was recorded on a 7 point Likert scale where 7 was easiest. Examine the data and determine the number of participants in the study.

```{r}
bf<-read_csv("bookflights.csv")
bf$Subject<-factor(bf$Subject)
bf$International<-factor(bf$International)
bf$Website<-factor(bf$Website)
bf$International<-factor(bf$International)
bf$Ease<-as.ordered(bf$Ease)
summary(bf)
```

Draw an interaction plot with Website on the x-axis and International as the traces. Determine how many times the traces cross.

```{r}
par(pin=c(2.75,1.25),cex=0.5)
with(bf,interaction.plot(Website,International,as.numeric(Ease),
			      ylim=c(0,max(as.numeric(bf$Ease)))))
```

Use ordinal logistic regression to examine Ease by Website and International. Report the $p$-value of the Website main effect.

```{r}
#. library(MASS) # provides polr()
#. library(car) # provides Anova()
#. set sum-to-zero contrasts for the Anova call
contrasts(bf$Website) <- "contr.sum"
contrasts(bf$International) <- "contr.sum"
m <- polr(Ease ~ Website*International, data=bf, Hess=TRUE)
Anova(m, type=3)
```

Conduct three pairwise comparisons of Ease between domestic and international for each service. Report the largest adjusted $p$-value. Use the same technique as above where you extracted the relevant unadjusted $p$-values manually and used `p.adjust()` to adjust them.

```{r}
summary(as.glht(pairs(lsmeans(m, pairwise ~ Website * International))),
        test=adjusted(type="none"))

p.adjust(c(1.44e-10,1.35e-12,0.474476),method="holm")
```

The above analyses indicate a significant main effect of Website on Ease.
The above analyses indicate a significant interaction between Website and International.
Expedia was perceived as significantly easier for booking international flights than domestic flights.
Orbitz, on the other hand, was perceived as significantly easier for booking domestic flights than international flights.
