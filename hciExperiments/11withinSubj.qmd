# Same person using different tools (Within subjects studies)

## Two search engines compared

```{r}
ws<-read_csv("websearch2.csv")
```

How many subjects took part in this study?

```{r}
ws$Subject<-factor(ws$Subject)
ws$Engine<-factor(ws$Engine)
summary(ws)
tail(ws)
```

Thirty subjects participated.

What is the average number of searches for the engine with the largest average number of searches?

```{r}
ws |>
  group_by(Engine) |>
  summarize(avg=mean(Searches))
```
Bing had 166 searches on average.

What is the $p$-value (four digits) from a paired-samples $t$-test of order effect?

```{r}
#. library(reshape2)
ws.wide.order <- dcast(ws,Subject ~ Order, value.var="Searches")
tst<-t.test(ws.wide.order$"1",ws.wide.order$"2",paired=TRUE,var.equal=TRUE)
tst
```
The $p$-value is 0.7343

What is the $t$-statistic (two digits) for a paired-samples $t$-test of Searches by Engine?

```{r}
#. library(reshape2)
ws.wide.engine <- dcast(ws,Subject ~ Engine, value.var="Searches")
tst<-t.test(ws.wide.engine$"Bing",ws.wide.engine$"Google",paired=TRUE,var.equal=TRUE)
tst
```
The $t$-statistic is 2.50.

What is the $p$-value (four digits) from a Wilcoxon signed-rank test on Effort?

```{r}
#. library(coin)
wilcoxsign_test(Effort~Engine|Subject,data=ws,distribution="exact")
```
The $p$-value is 0.5016.

## Same but with three search engines

```{r}
ws3<-read_csv("websearch3.csv")
```

How many subjects took part in this study?
```{r}
summary(ws3)
ws3$Subject<-as.factor(ws3$Subject)
ws3$Order<-as.factor(ws3$Order)
ws3$Engine<-as.factor(ws3$Engine)
tail(ws3)
```

Again, thirty subjects participated.

What is the average number of searches for the engine with the largest average number of searches?

```{r}
plyr::ddply(ws3,~ Engine,summarize, Mean=mean(Searches))
```
Yahoo required 172.40 searches on average.

Find Mauchly's $W$ criterion (four digits) as a value of violation of sphericity.

```{r}
#. library(ez)
m = ezANOVA(dv=Searches, within=Order, wid=Subject, data=ws3)
m$Mauchly
```
Mauchly's $W = 0.9416$, indicating that there is no violation of sphericity.

Conduct the appropriate ANOVA and give the $p$-value of the $F$-test (four digits).

```{r}
m$ANOVA
```
The relevant $p$-value is 0.3208.

Conduct a repeated measures ANOVA on Searches by Engine and give the Mauchly's $W$ criterion (four digits).

```{r}
#. library(ez)
m <- ezANOVA(dv=Searches, within=Engine, wid=Subject, data=ws3)
m$Mauchly
```
Mauchly's $W = 0.9420$, indicating that there is no violation of sphericity.

Conduct the appropriate ANOVA and give the $p$-value of the $F$-test (four digits).

```{r}
m$ANOVA
```
The relevant $p$-value is 0.0656.

Conduct post-hoc paired sample $t$-tests among levels of Engine, assuming equal variances and using "holm" to correct for multiple comparisons. What is the smallest $p$-value (four digits)?
```{r}
#. library(reshape2)
ws3.wide.engine <- dcast(ws3,Subject~Engine,value.var="Searches")
bi.go<-t.test(ws3.wide.engine$Bing,ws3.wide.engine$Google,paired=TRUE,var.equal=TRUE)
bi.ya<-t.test(ws3.wide.engine$Bing,ws3.wide.engine$Yahoo,paired=TRUE,var.equal=TRUE)
go.ya<-t.test(ws3.wide.engine$Google,ws3.wide.engine$Yahoo,paired=TRUE,var.equal=TRUE)
p.adjust(c(bi.go$p.value,bi.ya$p.value,go.ya$p.value),method="holm")
```
The smallest $p$-value is 0.0507.

Conduct a Friedman (nonparametric) test on Effort. Find the $\chi^2$ statistic (four digits).

```{r}
#. library(coin)
friedman_test(Effort~Engine|Subject,data=ws3,distribution="asymptotic")
```
$\chi^2=8.0182$

Conduct post hoc pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank tests on Effort by Engine with "holm" for multiple comparison correction. Give the smallest $p$-value (four digits).

```{r}
#. library(reshape2)
ws3.wide.effort <- dcast(ws3,Subject~Engine,value.var="Effort")
bi.go<-wilcox.test(ws3.wide.effort$Bing,ws3.wide.effort$Google,paired=TRUE,exact=FALSE)
bi.ya<-wilcox.test(ws3.wide.effort$Bing,ws3.wide.effort$Yahoo,paired=TRUE,exact=FALSE)
go.ya<-wilcox.test(ws3.wide.effort$Google,ws3.wide.effort$Yahoo,paired=TRUE,exact=FALSE)
p.adjust(c(bi.go$p.value,bi.ya$p.value,go.ya$p.value),method="holm")
```
The smallest $p$-value is 0.0309.
