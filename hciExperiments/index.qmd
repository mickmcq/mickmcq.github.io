Following are my course notes from a 2018 Coursera course called *Designing, Running, and Analyzing Experiments*, taught by Jacob Wobbrock, a prominent HCI scholar. Note that Wobbrock is in no way responsible for any errors or deviations from his presentation.

These course notes are an example of *reproducible research* and *literate programming*. They are reproducible research because the same file that generated this html document also ran all the experiments. This is an example of literate programming in the sense that the code, pictures, equations, and narrative are all encapsulated in one file. The source file for this project, along with the data files, are enough for you to reproduce the results and reproduce the documentation. All the source material is available in my github account, although in an obscure location therein.
