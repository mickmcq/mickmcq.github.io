I've been fortunate to be involved in some interesting research. Following are some recent publications.

[Shinohara (2021)](assets/Shinohara2021.pdf) continues the Disabled Grad Student project. This version, by the way, is more accessible than the copy in the ACM DL (growl!). This paper won an [Honorable Mention](assets/honmention2021.pdf) at CHI 2021.

[Shinohara (2020)](assets/Shinohara2020.pdf) is a conference paper at ASSETS 2020. It is the first paper in a series about the challenges faced by disabled graduate students in computing-intensive disciplines and how they meet these challenges.
