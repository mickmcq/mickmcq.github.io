00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.520
Michael McQuaid: Okay, so as, as was mentioned.

137
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:59.130
Michael McQuaid: Rochester child first is a not for profit agency dedicated to advancing the quality of early education and Karen was from New York through leadership advocacy and innovative services to children.

138
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.800
Michael McQuaid: Their main facility is this four acre location in the south wedge.

139
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:13.230
Michael McQuaid: Parents converge on this location every day at 9am and 3pm to drop off and pick up children, and it is a madhouse at these times.

140
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:15.690
Michael McQuaid: So an APP to help manage drop off and.

141
00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:17.040
Michael McQuaid: pick up would be welcome.

142
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:36.090
Michael McQuaid: And the childcare providers at RC and have the autonomy to use or reject Apps that appeal or don't appeal to them, there is currently an employee's shortage so also an APP that would help recruit child care providers would be welcome.

143
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:40.200
The current use of technology.

144
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:45.750
Michael McQuaid: Sorry did somebody say something.

145
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:59.250
Michael McQuaid: i'm getting a few people have are not muted and I think one of them is talking in the background, but i'm not sure.

146
00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:07.350
Michael McQuaid: But let me know if you want to talk, I mean yeah I can see the participant list here, even though I have the.

147
00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:12.030
Michael McQuaid: The screen share on so I can see raise your hand or.

148
00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.690
Michael McQuaid: feel free to jump in at any time.

149
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.370
Michael McQuaid: So.

150
00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:24.450
Michael McQuaid: The providers have seen reluctant to use Facebook, the parents don't use Twitter much in class dojo and other.

151
00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:33.660
Michael McQuaid: Education APP is helpful, but not a thorough source of two way communication so Apps that have you know, some two way communication could be welcome.

152
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:48.720
Michael McQuaid: And most parents have smartphones so even an APP that allows us to text them all at once, might help, so you could actually replicate some of the functions of social media in your APP and and that would potentially be welcome.

153
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:57.300
Michael McQuaid: and important challenges to make an APP that's open to parents, but not open to predators.

154
00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:11.850
Michael McQuaid: Potential predators, so there are different audiences for an APP parents for picking up they might want to be able to say that they might be late or they might want to say i'm on my way.

155
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:17.700
Michael McQuaid: And for parents to communicate with teachers about what their children are doing right now.

156
00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:25.140
Michael McQuaid: manager, would like to know which parents, they need to approach during the 3pm crush regarding late payments.

157
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:42.480
Michael McQuaid: prospective parents and prospective donors may need info that's on the website, but delivered differently or who made need timely messages about fundraisers raffles silent auctions casino night and the mad hatter tea party, which are fundraising activities that they do.

158
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:47.220
Michael McQuaid: And the childcare providers may want to communicate with parents.

159
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:59.310
Michael McQuaid: And it can be hard to reach prospective employees, particularly now during the pandemic, so an APP that that reaches out to potential recruits could be valuable.

160
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:12.600
Michael McQuaid: Now there are some things that are really important to them that are really important darcy and that surface, when we talk, it must be inclusive of different races ethnicities and abilities.

161
00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:24.000
Michael McQuaid: It must communicate that we're professionals, there are a lot of child focused Apps that are two cartoonish in appearance and don't communicate that the people behind them are really professionals.

162
00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:31.410
Michael McQuaid: And, of course, an APP must be easy for people who are not computer savvy even the Facebook group was a tough sell.

163
00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.040
Michael McQuaid: So something that's just blindingly easy.

164
00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:39.990
Michael McQuaid: could be a great benefit.

165
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:47.430
Michael McQuaid: Okay, so those are all the slides that I have what kinds of questions do you have about rcn.

166
00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:53.880
Matthew Incardona: mute myself.

167
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:55.590
Michael McQuaid: yeah.

168
00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.850
Matthew Incardona: Alright, I hope everyone can hear me fine my microphone has been having several issues this week.

169
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.380
Michael McQuaid: I hear you just fine.

170
00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:05.310
Matthew Incardona: Okay perfect does rcn have anyone.

171
00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:10.470
Matthew Incardona: Any like customers, we could interview and out or ask for questions for or do any kind of testing.

172
00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:17.160
Jeff Hoffman: um yes, we could.

173
00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:29.040
Jeff Hoffman: Set you up, I mean it would just be a matter of you know we're closed that Monday so it'd be matter of getting to somebody you know Tuesday or Wednesday, you know parent or some teachers.

174
00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:44.790
Jeff Hoffman: If you have my contact information which is just Jay Hoffman at rcn for the number for kids orgy yeah should be able to facilitate that it just it will be a real short timeline.

175
00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:48.360
Matthew Incardona: Alright, thanks so much for the offer, though.

176
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:49.950
Jeff Hoffman: Oh, thank you.

177
00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.640
Michael McQuaid: Oh somebody is already.

178
00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:00.000
Michael McQuaid: put it in, but I think it's Jay Hoffman not Jeff Hoffman isn't it.

179
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:02.940
Jeff Hoffman: Correct che Hoffman.

180
00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.660
Jeff Hoffman: There you go yes.

181
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:13.500
Michael McQuaid: I know I put it, I put kids spelled kids wrong.

182
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.940
Michael McQuaid: No, I can't even edit it.

183
00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:21.120
Michael McQuaid: I can't edit it and I can't delete it.

184
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.180
Matthew Incardona: I think kids is close enough.

185
00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:36.930
Michael McQuaid: My email program won't understand it, but someone might Okay, a couple of questions, a couple of more people have their hands up matt has his hand up.

186
00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:45.540
Matthew P Sciubba: yeah um, I guess, my question is other than you mentioned that the child pickup and drop off is one of the more hectic.

187
00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:55.290
Matthew P Sciubba: scenarios that you guys have is there anything else that comes to mind with one of your like biggest challenges at the moment, other than that.

188
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:06.180
Jeff Hoffman: hmm and feel free to jump in as i'm as i'm trying to think of things in it, you know the technology, I think it is a.

189
00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:16.650
Jeff Hoffman: challenge justin says, most of our parents, you have a lot of lower income parents and most of them, if not all, would have a smartphone or or.

190
00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:27.570
Jeff Hoffman: You know, some kind of connection, you know they could get through their phone, but a lot I don't think you know, have a home computer or even have a.

191
00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:39.630
Jeff Hoffman: tablet or a laptop so that you know I think that's part of what we want to be able to to reach all of our parents that might not be such a big issue with prospective employees.

192
00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:46.710
Jeff Hoffman: gosh can you think of anything else really pressing deb that comes up on a regular basis.

193
00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:51.120
Debora Hughes - RCN: Well, I think Kovac gave us challenges that we've never had before, so I.

194
00:33:51.120 --> 00:34:03.870
Debora Hughes - RCN: Think just quick communication meaning, you know um you know, a surge or closing certain classrooms or you know things like that that we want to get out that's gotta be.

195
00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:19.230
Debora Hughes - RCN: Not like an email that they might read or they might not till like nighttime so something that we can do mass communications very, very easily and quickly that they will get on their phone so before they even get the kids dressed.

196
00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:29.310
Debora Hughes - RCN: You know what I mean that it's going to pop up on their phone Nice and easy and is not having to like text a million people in that kind of thing so call it definitely gave us additional challenges.

197
00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:36.600
Matthew P Sciubba: yeah The thing that comes to mind when you mentioned, that is the way that amber alerts work I know it's nothing as extreme as that but something.

198
00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:49.860
Matthew P Sciubba: Would you say that's something as simple as like a notification system with maybe doesn't even have like an interface for them to use would be a useful thing just something where just like a notification pops up on their phone for like emergency communications and things like that.

199
00:34:49.920 --> 00:35:03.510
Debora Hughes - RCN: Well, so the difference, I would say is we usually communicate on not just were closed due to like we give a little bit more information because usually, when you're dealing with children and our staff.

200
00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:11.610
Debora Hughes - RCN: there's more information than just a quick alert that were closed or don't bring your kid today kind of thing it's more so.

201
00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:27.540
Debora Hughes - RCN: A communication, a conversation, do you know what I mean so it's not just a quick alert I would I mean that would be great, but I think it's it's a little bit more than that because we actually want to service our employees and our.

202
00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:32.340
Debora Hughes - RCN: Parents more than just an alert does that make sense, because if.

203
00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:41.190
Debora Hughes - RCN: You say we're close to cove it that's an alarming we don't want to alarm them, we want to inform them does that make sense.

204
00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:45.030
Matthew P Sciubba: Something something with the functionality of like a two way communication.

205
00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:59.250
Debora Hughes - RCN: yeah because if anybody has questions we definitely want to shut down any you know assumptions and or you know somebody being you know uneasy about things, we definitely want to respond quickly.

206
00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:01.470
Matthew P Sciubba: That makes sense.

207
00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:06.960
Debora Hughes - RCN: And I think to just recruiting as I recruit I mean indeed is great.

208
00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:18.600
Debora Hughes - RCN: But I think we could probably reach different groups of people if we had a platform to do so and I don't really know what that looks like I mean.

209
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:36.150
Debora Hughes - RCN: we're looking at all different age groups, all different levels of you know tech savvy people versus still with a flip phone, so I don't really know what that looks like but recruiting is always a struggle, always a struggle.

210
00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:44.430
Michael McQuaid: Okay cool um Alex has a hand up oh i'm sorry Matthew did we finish answering your question.

211
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:46.050
Matthew P Sciubba: Yes, thank you.

212
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:48.390
Michael McQuaid: Alex have a hand up.

213
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:58.230
Alex Kalomiris: So i'm remembering correctly, you mentioned that the pickup and drop off times are always really crazy.

214
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.910
Jeff Hoffman: Oh yes, for the most part, yes.

215
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:04.470
So.

216
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:13.590
Debora Hughes - RCN: So the thing was drop off and pick up and that is.

217
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:25.860
Debora Hughes - RCN: Due to coven we can have you know 15 parents coming at three o'clock and coming into the building we can't we can't accommodate that so many times.

218
00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:36.750
Debora Hughes - RCN: Parents are standing outside versus if they could message us and we can message them on a platform that says okay we're going to bring your child up to the door.

219
00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:45.780
Debora Hughes - RCN: Will will let you know when you can come to the door versus having people standing outside, because we can only have so many people in the four year.

220
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.970
Debora Hughes - RCN: Because it's very small and all parents are coming in at three o'clock pick up their kid or dropping off.

221
00:37:51.450 --> 00:38:04.860
Debora Hughes - RCN: So I think something that you know, like when you go to the doctors and you get a text that you can come in, or you can't come in Whatever the case may be something some something like that would be helpful and then again is due to coven.

222
00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.380
Michael McQuaid: Right good to know.

223
00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:16.950
Jeff Hoffman: yeah and I think also when we're open from you know basically from seven in the morning till 530 but.

224
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:25.950
Jeff Hoffman: For before and aftercare but the crunch time to really that the other issue that comes up sometime during the crunch, time is.

225
00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:37.980
Jeff Hoffman: Identification in the sense that we you know we have a child, and both mother and father are on our list and pick them up, but mom and dad couldn't show up today.

226
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:52.290
Jeff Hoffman: And they said grandma well we don't know grandma and we can had a child off to grandma just because, just because she says, you know so so, even if the child seems to you know recognize the person.

227
00:38:53.790 --> 00:39:06.330
Jeff Hoffman: So I think that goes back to to mix issue about this needs to be accessible, but it also needs to be you know protected information so not just anybody can can get access to it.

228
00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:08.220
Michael McQuaid: Okay, good to know.

229
00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:14.070
Michael McQuaid: Now Alex says he has a follow up question that he's going to type in because his roommate is talking.

230
00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.130
Michael McQuaid: So Alex did you want to type in your follow up question or.

231
00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:24.480
Alex Kalomiris: Oh yeah i'm doing that now sorry.

232
00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:25.350
Okay.

233
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:31.560
Michael McQuaid: So after that we have masha and she busy both have questions.

234
00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.250
Michael McQuaid: Maybe we can take measures question, while we're waiting.

235
00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:07.260
Mesha Johnson (RIT Student): So my question is with the arm with the notification you guys are thinking about for the for the APP.

236
00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:14.670
Mesha Johnson (RIT Student): Are you thinking of having just one single person, maybe somebody who works in the office sending out these sort of messages or any updates on the child are you thinking.

237
00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:27.300
Mesha Johnson (RIT Student): The teacher would have access to sort of their own idea of the Platform or their own section in the platform and and they'll have like their class list in my next sort of words, how do you guys do that on your end now and then the power you begin to look.

238
00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:33.990
Debora Hughes - RCN: Good question, I honestly don't know.

239
00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:37.560
Jeff Hoffman: yeah that is a great question um.

240
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:53.220
Jeff Hoffman: When kids, especially when when kids are picked up at three o'clock in the afternoon, a lot of times the the teacher will help out with that mean they know that you know johnny's parents always come at 305 or 310.

241
00:40:54.390 --> 00:41:07.860
Jeff Hoffman: But still, it at the end of the day, I think we would want someone in the front office to actually Okay, you know, every time every time a child is coming and going.

242
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:20.730
Jeff Hoffman: And you know my my thought is deb i'm not sure we'd want to teach her to say oh okay your parents here, you know you can leave now and then the front office not know that their childhood left.

243
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.950
Jeff Hoffman: there's that kind of.

244
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.660
Jeff Hoffman: wishes I kind of get to the point of your question.

245
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:34.080
Mesha Johnson (RIT Student): yeah I think everything just sort of one just thinking about when I was in school and like sort of attendance tracking but.

246
00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:48.480
Mesha Johnson (RIT Student): If it just thinking of like sort of a solution if the APP is the teacher would have to check off this student is leaving on the APP and then that would be that would like update automatically in the system for whoever's in the front office would that be a feasible solution.

247
00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:54.330
Debora Hughes - RCN: I think that actually would be a very good check and balance on our end.

248
00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:57.420
Debora Hughes - RCN: So that the office, the teacher everybody's on the same page and we can.

249
00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:02.970
Debora Hughes - RCN: All see it as alive um you know active document of.

250
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.510
Debora Hughes - RCN: data.

251
00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:04.650
Debora Hughes - RCN: Do you know what I mean, so that we.

252
00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:13.500
Debora Hughes - RCN: can actually know at any given point a snapshot of who's here who's been picked up and if there are any issues or problems, we would be able to see it immediately.

253
00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.300
Debora Hughes - RCN: and not have to like walk.

254
00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:19.560
Debora Hughes - RCN: Clear across the building to to see a child, or whatever you know what I mean.

255
00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:21.030
Mesha Johnson (RIT Student): yeah okay.

256
00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:28.410
Michael McQuaid: Okay, great so Alex put his question, so at those punch times would that doctor's.

257
00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:37.860
Michael McQuaid: office two way communication style be preferable to say parents being able to schedule staggered pick off pickup dropoff times as the example solution that came to mind.

258
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:53.850
Debora Hughes - RCN: Well, it has to be staggered So the answer would be yes um although pickup time three o'clock some get there a few minutes early some get there a few minutes late, so they could let us know they're outside.

259
00:42:54.390 --> 00:43:02.820
Debora Hughes - RCN: We could, so what happens is is parents can't go into the classrooms anymore, they only go to the front door and just so you understand, we have greeters.

260
00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:10.920
Debora Hughes - RCN: That when somebody comes to pick up a child at the door they go back or they call the the classroom and they walk the child up front.

261
00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:16.260
Debora Hughes - RCN: So before the parents would just walk into the classroom and grab their child to to call, but we can't do that.

262
00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:32.730
Debora Hughes - RCN: So if the parent would say i'm here to pick up such and such there's a check and balance that the child is supposed to go with that person, and then the greeter would go and get the child and bring him to the door, then the parent would be notified that the child's ready at the door.

263
00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.610
Debora Hughes - RCN: Does that answer your question or no.

264
00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:51.120
Alex Kalomiris: um I think so so you'd rather have parents just be able to say oh i'm i'm here, and then they come in in like the order that they come in, but slowly rather than oh this group of parents is.

265
00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:54.210
Alex Kalomiris: This group is like 258 this group and.

266
00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:56.970
Debora Hughes - RCN: We wouldn't do that we wouldn't do that so we're.

267
00:43:57.090 --> 00:44:04.140
Debora Hughes - RCN: we're trying to be very serviceable to the parents and it and it is a three o'clock pickup like, and it is a nine o'clock drop off.

268
00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:16.200
Debora Hughes - RCN: Just like school, you know I mean you wouldn't like classrooms if you're going into class starts at a certain time and ends at a certain time so staggered I don't I don't necessarily think that works.

269
00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:20.730
Debora Hughes - RCN: I think just whoever comes first come, first serve and.

270
00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:34.920
Debora Hughes - RCN: you're in a list and we'll get your child as soon as we can, but we just can't have every I don't want everyone standing in 90 degree heat, or you know 10 degree weather outside because they walk up to the building and we still have to go get their child.

271
00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:35.910
Jeff Hoffman: mm hmm.

272
00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:46.470
Jeff Hoffman: This might be a completely separate APP else it's a great question but that those are the main pickup dropoff times, but we will still have kids here till.

273
00:44:46.950 --> 00:45:03.780
Jeff Hoffman: You know 435 o'clock 534 after school care, so there might be some kind of functionality about you know hey i'm you know at five o'clock that a parent of one of those kids could Texas, and say i'll be there in five minutes.

274
00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:16.380
Jeff Hoffman: That that could be helpful we're focusing on our crunch times of nine to three, but that you know for some parents say they could be helpful to say i'm coming to 430 i'm coming at five o'clock.

275
00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:26.580
Michael McQuaid: OK cool so she has a question she couldn't raise her hand in in zoom for some reason, but she has a question.

276
00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:28.920
Shwetha S: Hello.

277
00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.050
Michael McQuaid: Yes.

278
00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:35.610
Shwetha S: yeah hi I have two questions first was.

279
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:51.270
Shwetha S: mentioned that the APP should reflect that you're professionals and it shouldn't be too childish, but is there any particular team or brand that you would like us to integrate into the APP.

280
00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:58.560
Jeff Hoffman: You know, for any for any visuals that are that are on there yeah we would share the.

281
00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:08.370
Jeff Hoffman: The RCM logo our Green and White RC and logo for any kind of you know, visible interface yeah that would that would be wonderful.

282
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:10.230
Shwetha S: Okay.

283
00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:21.270
Debora Hughes - RCN: I certainly don't want busy Do you know what I mean so like not just cartoonish kind of stuff but we don't want busy very, very simple very user friendly.

284
00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:31.830
Shwetha S: Is there any color palette that you guys have in mind for us to use or that we should follow so that it takes to your brand.

285
00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:40.020
Jeff Hoffman: Yes, and if I can, if I can find that on Tuesday i'll shoot it over to MC yeah we have.

286
00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:43.080
Michael McQuaid: On the website, if you if you do that.

287
00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:44.520
Jeff Hoffman: i'm sorry.

288
00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:49.470
Michael McQuaid: i'll put it on the website, if you do that and i'll message everyone.

289
00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:58.800
Jeff Hoffman: Okay yeah because that the green you're looking at is a specific green number that I forget what the number is but.

290
00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:02.820
Jeff Hoffman: yeah we do, we do have a very specific color palette.

291
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:10.230
Debora Hughes - RCN: keep in mind for anybody, that is an APP person we want our APP.

292
00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:18.570
Debora Hughes - RCN: To be very identifiable so you know they have 30 Apps on their phone for the people that are more smartphone savvy.

293
00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:29.070
Debora Hughes - RCN: that ours is is very easy to identify whether it be our logo or something else, but that it's it's a go to do you I mean they don't have to like look for it it's very identifiable.

294
00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:31.140
Shwetha S: Okay.

295
00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:34.230
Shwetha S: And the other one was that.

296
00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:38.550
Shwetha S: You wanted the APP to be inclusive of.

297
00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:49.890
Shwetha S: ethnicities are jays are also ability so Is there something specific about like any accessibility issues that you want us to target.

298
00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:54.750
Debora Hughes - RCN: We have it in English and Spanish.

299
00:47:57.570 --> 00:47:57.900
Shwetha S: Okay.

300
00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.790
Debora Hughes - RCN: I know i'm reaching but.

301
00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:05.580
Shwetha S: I was thinking along the lines of should we be.

302
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:14.430
Shwetha S: Focusing on color palette that's also helpful for color plan individual and.

303
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:17.700
Shwetha S: It should we be concerned about.

304
00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.150
Shwetha S: Being blind friendly as well, and anyway.

305
00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:32.910
Jeff Hoffman: wow that would be amazing i'm not sure how they would operate, I know, we have had a couple parents.

306
00:48:34.770 --> 00:48:36.600
Jeff Hoffman: Who are deaf but.

307
00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:39.870
Jeff Hoffman: Oh gosh I.

308
00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:51.600
Jeff Hoffman: that's a really interesting question about you know it, you know whether it was verbal or whatever for people who are are blind I don't know deb, what do you, what do you think about that one.

309
00:48:53.760 --> 00:49:00.060
Debora Hughes - RCN: I think, and I don't know if this is the right way to say it, I think it would be a nice if we could.

310
00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:07.800
Debora Hughes - RCN: But I don't see it as necessarily like on my wish list at the top of my wish list does that make sense.

311
00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:10.440
Shwetha S: yep.

312
00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:20.640
Jeff Hoffman: yeah I agree and plus you know not to focus on one thing, but if we're going to the rush times of pickup and drop off those are you know.

313
00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:24.690
Jeff Hoffman: Those are cited people who typically are driving here to pick up their kids.

314
00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:27.780
Shwetha S: But I do know.

315
00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:42.240
Debora Hughes - RCN: That we do have people that translate in Spanish, for some of our parents and families and even employees, so if there was a selection to do the APP in English or Spanish, I think that would.

316
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:54.150
Debora Hughes - RCN: touch a whole different group of individuals, whether it be for recruiting purposes or just communication that's clear for people that aren't as good with English.

317
00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:58.560
Jeff Hoffman: Absolutely yeah the Spanish could be very important for us.

318
00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:01.230
Jeff Hoffman: Okay.

319
00:50:01.290 --> 00:50:01.740
Shwetha S: Thank you.

320
00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:08.310
Michael McQuaid: Great so um it looks like another Matthew has another question Matthew in Cardona.

321
00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:16.320
Matthew Incardona: Hello again um as far as a copy or any kind of you know content words media, etc.

322
00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:21.270
Matthew Incardona: Are we providing placeholders for that or are you going to be providing.

323
00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:23.940
Matthew Incardona: You know the media or the content.

324
00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:32.490
Michael McQuaid: I would think that you're going.

325
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:34.950
Michael McQuaid: you're going to provide place.

326
00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:39.810
Michael McQuaid: I don't think that they're going to have time to do that, personally.

327
00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:44.670
Jeff Hoffman: I think that would make sense yeah I would agree and it's.

328
00:50:46.410 --> 00:51:04.530
Jeff Hoffman: yeah I guess my concept of placeholders is once we have the APP and be available and we could you know we could create standardized messages about we're closing early today because of snow or whether or you know, whatever but yeah I think you're right, that would be.

329
00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:11.250
Jeff Hoffman: placeholders and not perfect, specific text for every situation.

330
00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:13.290
Matthew Incardona: Okay, thank you.

331
00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:28.200
Michael McQuaid: Okay, now I noticed that there are some people here who are not registered who are on the call and i'm wondering if there are people who wanted to participate in the design jam who didn't get to register.

332
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:33.150
Michael McQuaid: Because i'm seeing a couple of unfamiliar names.

333
00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:44.700
Michael McQuaid: Now, it could be some people use multiple names, so that that could be it, but if you haven't registered for this, I want you to at least messaged me in the chat.

334
00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:58.470
Michael McQuaid: And misha has another question which is how detailed, are you looking for all this to be, what do you hope to see visually to help get an understanding of the overall APP.

335
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:00.810
Michael McQuaid: And I think.

336
00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:07.050
Michael McQuaid: there's probably a happy medium that that they're going to be looking for.

337
00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:10.260
Michael McQuaid: In terms of detail.

338
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:24.900
Michael McQuaid: That you know there's a degree of detail that will become inflexible that will be too much and then there's too sketchy so My guess you guys may want to answer that but I guess would be.

339
00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:39.810
Jeff Hoffman: Well, let me yeah let me ask you a question with a question, you know, whichever design I you know would be chosen or would be the winner, you know if we knew.

340
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:57.450
Jeff Hoffman: Who the person was who who did, that the student was it did that and we're using it for a couple weeks or a month and then, could you know can be contacted student back and say hey could you could you make this change to it, or you know what would that be reasonable request or not.

341
00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:01.980
Michael McQuaid: Well, what these students are doing on.

342
00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:04.620
Michael McQuaid: Those are not usable asked.

343
00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:06.360
Jeff Hoffman: Okay okay.

344
00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:07.710
Jeff Hoffman: Design design.

345
00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:09.720
Michael McQuaid: I luckily I happen to have a.

346
00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:14.880
Michael McQuaid: class that builds Apps based on designs and we've actually.

347
00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:15.150
built.

348
00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:21.120
Michael McQuaid: So those would be students that you might want to.

349
00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:21.810
contact.

350
00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:32.580
Michael McQuaid: Or, I mean i'm actually going to contact them anyway, but um there's students if you're if you're using the APP.

351
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:33.600
Jeff Hoffman: Is wanted to tweak it.

352
00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:38.100
Michael McQuaid: it's the implement or is that you would probably talk to, and then the implementation.

353
00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:38.310
Like.

354
00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:42.000
Jeff Hoffman: Okay.

355
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:44.850
Michael McQuaid: Thanks, for we might all get in the same room together.

356
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:46.170
Michael McQuaid: At the same time I don't know.

357
00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:53.340
Michael McQuaid: Okay, so let me go on to the other.

358
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:55.980
Michael McQuaid: I don't see any other questions here.

359
00:53:56.250 --> 00:54:05.820
Michael McQuaid: So I want to go on to the other slideshow so we don't have a representative from Rochester green innovation, but I have a few things to say about it.

360
00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:18.180
Michael McQuaid: Rochester green innovation is completely volunteer run and they run a store downtown at 850 St Paul street.

361
00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:37.890
Michael McQuaid: And it is an 18,000 square foot facility, they also have an eBay store and a posh mark store, but these are run by volunteers with limited time and these stores only show a few items, they have a vast collection of items in their 18,000 foot 18,000 square foot space.

362
00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:52.710
Michael McQuaid: And they haven't fragmented online presence, so they have different volunteers who separately run you know non integrated Facebook instagram and tick tock presences.

363
00:54:54.420 --> 00:55:04.890
Michael McQuaid: Facebook, is the first hit when I Google Rochester green innovation Rochester green innovation has a website that's not to maintained that comes up seven.

364
00:55:05.550 --> 00:55:17.430
Michael McQuaid: instagram and tick tock don't come up on a search, they are first on a yelp search for Rochester thrift store, but they don't appear on the first page of Rochester secondhand.

365
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:21.150
Michael McQuaid: So they have, and these are images from their.

366
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:23.460
Michael McQuaid: Facebook page.

367
00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:35.040
Michael McQuaid: They have different kinds of traffic, they have 30% of their traffic coming from Facebook 15% coming from and that's probably because Facebook, is the most.

368
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:37.080
Michael McQuaid: Currently.

369
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:56.880
Michael McQuaid: up to date, page it's the most well maintained page than instagram than walk ins without social media people who Google people who are new to the area people who just look up secondhand stores in Rochester and then a whopping 30% that they don't know where they come from.

370
00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:05.940
Michael McQuaid: And a typical visit can last from 30 minutes, so you need 30 minutes to cover the place because there's so much stuff.

371
00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:17.430
Michael McQuaid: and frequently they have visitors who stay for three hours, believe it or not, i'm not really a big shopper so that that number really floored me.

372
00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:24.420
Michael McQuaid: And they have several different kinds of visitors, they have people who are just looking around people who love thrifty.

373
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:29.190
Michael McQuaid: People who are looking for something in particular, such as a desk or a couch or a table.

374
00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:44.790
Michael McQuaid: They have slumlords coming into furnished apartments resellers and flippers who just want to buy things and resell them on more organized sites and then there are just people who are looking for deals if they can find a bargain they're happy.

375
00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:59.070
Michael McQuaid: The inventory is kept very simply, everything is just recorded as being one of 50 categories and Here are some examples of categories and their biggest category is miscellaneous.

376
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:11.100
Michael McQuaid: And they have a total of about 50 of these things, and it occurs to me that you know, an APP that allows you to assign tags to photographs that are tags of these.

377
00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:16.830
Michael McQuaid: 50 types might be really advantageous for them.

378
00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:33.540
Michael McQuaid: The volunteers are always pressed for time, most of the volunteers communicate through texts and phone calls, but there are a couple of volunteers who have no tech at all, most of the volunteers, have a set schedule, but some just pop into the store whenever they feel like it.

379
00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:42.480
Michael McQuaid: and green innovation also works with agencies, there are about five agencies in Rochester that help mentally challenged adults find work.

380
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:54.660
Michael McQuaid: and their clients volunteer at green innovation to prep for paying jobs, and those are our volunteers and there, there is a network of communication with the agencies that.

381
00:57:57.120 --> 00:58:04.050
Michael McQuaid: liaison with them and then, if renovation has to close for any emergency which they did in October.

382
00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:13.920
Michael McQuaid: They have to make about 25 phone calls and texts to volunteers and agencies so that's kind of the population of their.

383
00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:18.510
Michael McQuaid: Their universe of immediate contacts.

384
00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:30.660
Michael McQuaid: So there are a lot of design opportunities It may very well be the case that an APP is going to work better than a website, because most people are physically in the store.

385
00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:35.430
Michael McQuaid: When they're concerned about the store and they would be able to use it on their phones.

386
00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:52.800
Michael McQuaid: photos are a really big deal, so an APP that encourage people to post interview photos of merchandise, and that was usable by non tech savvy shoppers might work better than instagram or tick tock.

387
00:58:54.360 --> 00:59:04.980
Michael McQuaid: Communication is a big thing for them if there was one place that all volunteers and shoppers could trust to the latest updates or give their own updates might work better than Twitter.

388
00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:19.890
Michael McQuaid: And a connection to agree innovations many online incarnations may be helpful so many of renovations volunteers and clients don't know about all the different things that volunteers are up to.

389
00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:24.180
Michael McQuaid: So an APP that had a page just.

390
00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:27.300
Michael McQuaid: Connecting to their Facebook their.

391
00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:34.260
Michael McQuaid: Their instagram their tick tock and so on, might be useful.

392
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:45.540
Michael McQuaid: Okay, so that's all I have on a green innovation, I might I might say one thing that I think is really important, which is that.

393
00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:49.020
Michael McQuaid: they're not looking for an e commerce APP.

394
00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:55.680
Michael McQuaid: And I don't think that they would be able to support an e commerce APP.

395
00:59:57.180 --> 00:59:59.700
Michael McQuaid: I think they're looking for something much simpler than that.

396
01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:09.330
Michael McQuaid: And I think this you know this is kind of a key thing this photos thing.

397
01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:20.400
Michael McQuaid: Okay does anybody want to ask me, so I have some knowledge of of Rochester green innovation so if anybody wants to ask me questions.

398
01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:27.930
Michael McQuaid: I see that two people still have their hands up but that may be from before I don't know Matthew in Cardona.

399
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:30.540
Michael McQuaid: Did you have a new question.

400
01:00:36.090 --> 01:00:37.650
Matthew Incardona: Sorry, no, it was my Han solo.

401
01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:38.790
Michael McQuaid: yeah.

402
01:00:39.210 --> 01:00:39.960
Matthew Incardona: And then about.

403
01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:43.740
Michael McQuaid: The other Matthew also as it stands still up yeah.

404
01:00:44.310 --> 01:00:45.870
Matthew P Sciubba: I do have a question actually.

405
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:58.800
Matthew P Sciubba: Okay, so when you say like not an e commerce APP The thing that comes to mind are these Apps out there, like offer up where you can post things that you want for sale.

406
01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:14.850
Matthew P Sciubba: That you want to sell like, if I have like an old item in my house, I can put on there, and I can sell it, but they also have categories, and they also have a ton of images, so are they just sort of looking for a way to have more Canada more categories and more.

407
01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:24.240
Matthew P Sciubba: Specific ones that people can just browse to see if they have a certain item like an A and like almost like a just an inventory type APP.

408
01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:40.320
Michael McQuaid: I think that would be very useful, but I don't think that they want more categories, I think if they could, if if they could get an APP that would allow people would allow individuals either volunteers or customers to.

409
01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:46.770
Michael McQuaid: upload photos that they have things that they see in the store and want to comment on.

410
01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:56.130
Matthew P Sciubba: I think that would be very useful Okay, and like so the volunteers would also would they also use this APP to update the inventory of the new items come in.

411
01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:00.810
Michael McQuaid: That would be a potential possibility.

412
01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:11.430
Michael McQuaid: I mean we that will be pretty easy to implement if they had this capability to to post and review photos.

413
01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:18.810
Michael McQuaid: yeah um it wouldn't be hard application wise to run that into an inventory system.

414
01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:23.040
Michael McQuaid: Okay, but they don't have a complicated inventory system right now.

415
01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:29.010
Shwetha S: Professor I have a question.

416
01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:29.880
yeah.

417
01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:45.960
Shwetha S: So in the slide about the volunteers, it was a there was a good point about the case that they have to close for an emergency, they would have to make about 25 phone calls and text volunteers and agencies.

418
01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:49.110
Shwetha S: Do we have to make any.

419
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:59.970
Shwetha S: Anything for this particular case, because they want an opera volunteers can communicate with one another and.

420
01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:03.060
Shwetha S: give an information or anything.

421
01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:07.110
Michael McQuaid: Announcements or chat would probably be very beneficial.

422
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:12.090
Michael McQuaid: So chat thing that would allow them to.

423
01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:25.320
Michael McQuaid: To make announcements and also for volunteers to say you know i'm coming in now, or I can't come in, now a communication channel within the APP that everyone who's logged in could see.

424
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:33.300
Michael McQuaid: would potentially be very beneficial, as a matter of fact, one thing that has occurred to me is that they should probably have.

425
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:35.280
Michael McQuaid: To.

426
01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:44.820
Michael McQuaid: The APP should have two levels, there should be stuff that the public can see without logging in and then stuff that you would have to log in to be able to see.

427
01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:54.120
Shwetha S: Yes, and also regarding people posting your views and posts in general.

428
01:03:55.740 --> 01:04:08.970
Shwetha S: What would the volunteers be working on skimming through them and verifying if the legitimate or if there's been any effect on and, if so, do we need to you know have.

429
01:04:10.590 --> 01:04:13.230
Shwetha S: The gift volunteer or some sort of power.

430
01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:15.540
Michael McQuaid: and control so very good idea.

431
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:18.480
Michael McQuaid: That I mean.

432
01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:23.490
Michael McQuaid: that's something that I think would be very helpful for you to to implement.

433
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:34.710
Michael McQuaid: Okay, and then I saw somebody else had a hand up.

434
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:37.650
Michael McQuaid: But they put it down.

435
01:04:38.850 --> 01:04:40.290
Michael McQuaid: And Matthews hand is still up.

436
01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.720
Matthew P Sciubba: Oh i'm sorry i'm I don't have another question.

437
01:04:49.110 --> 01:04:50.370
Michael McQuaid: Okay, all right.

438
01:04:50.550 --> 01:05:08.790
Michael McQuaid: So what i'd like to do now so it's so um let me ask if there are any general questions before we enter the breakout rooms were a little bit late on entering the breakout rooms, the idea is that you begin discussing which not for profits, you would like to work with and.

439
01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:11.850
Michael McQuaid: There is a.

440
01:05:18.090 --> 01:05:19.440
Michael McQuaid: There is not a thing here.

441
01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:28.110
Michael McQuaid: Okay, there is no did I really leave this out so there's a call tricks.

442
01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:39.360
Michael McQuaid: Page where I would like each team to put in what you want to who you want to work with and i'll have to put that.

443
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:44.760
Michael McQuaid: Call tricks page in the chat because, for some reason I didn't put it on the website, I can put it on the website.

444
01:05:45.180 --> 01:06:00.990
Michael McQuaid: Also, but i'll put it in the chat after you've had some time in the breakout rooms so i'm going to create nine breakout rooms and i'd like you to use the breakout room that corresponds to your team number, so I sent out an email with your team number.

445
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:26.190
Michael McQuaid: And let me do the breakout rooms now, and so the teams are numbered one through nine in the breakout rooms are going to be numbered one through nine so go to.

446
01:06:27.330 --> 01:06:34.740
Michael McQuaid: The the one that corresponds to your team number, and if you don't know what your team number is just asked me, and I will.

447
01:06:39.030 --> 01:06:39.900
Michael McQuaid: I will tell you.

448
01:06:43.350 --> 01:06:45.480
Michael McQuaid: All the tricks is on the page with the agenda.

449
01:06:54.780 --> 01:07:01.710
Michael McQuaid: Oh good okay so i'm sorry I did put that on I just forgot, where I put it so if you go to the agenda, page.

450
01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.760
Michael McQuaid: you'll put in your team number and.

451
01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:13.260
Michael McQuaid: Which which not for profit, you would like to work with.

452
01:07:14.790 --> 01:07:29.790
Michael McQuaid: And you're not necessarily so, there are nine teams, there are two non profits i'm going to put a sign four of you to one and five of you to the other so you're not necessarily going to get your first choice, but please do put in your first choice.

453
01:07:42.570 --> 01:07:44.550
Michael McQuaid: Okay, and then I see a lot of people haven't.

454
01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:53.010
Michael McQuaid: haven't gone into breakout rooms, but i'm not seeing okay so somebody did ask.

455
01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:54.480
_Interpreter: Ellen Cooper: OK.

456
01:07:55.290 --> 01:07:57.750
Michael McQuaid: OK, so the interpreter should go to breakout room.

457
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:59.520
_Interpreter: Ellen Cooper: 404 okay.

458
01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.980
Michael McQuaid: i'm sorry no breakout room five.

459
01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:02.460

Li Wang (RIT Student): I prefer some like I didn't see the break out rooms i'm in team six, I think.

470
01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:41.220
Michael McQuaid: Okay, so you should be able to see the breakout rooms at the bottom of the screen or at the bottom of the the window, there should be an option for.

471

492
01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:48.000

500
01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:28.740
Michael McQuaid: By the way, do I need to re enable co host or interpreters still enabled.

501
01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:37.020
_Interpreter: Ellen Cooper: we're still cars.

502
01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:40.950
Michael McQuaid: Okay, I don't know how the breakout rooms actually.

503
01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:47.670

545
01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:37.740

01:28:38.850 --> 01:28:40.290
Michael McQuaid: expressed a preference.

547

549
01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:17.430
Michael McQuaid: Three teams that haven't expressed a preference i'm going to assign to Rochester innovation and all the rest are going to be Rochester child first network so that's team one team to team three.
