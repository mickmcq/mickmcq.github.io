00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Sabrina Are you also a, an interpreter.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Kiersten workout workhouse be will be the second interpreter she's not here yet.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Okay, so I don't know who Sabrina is,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I believe.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Are you a capitalists Rena.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I cannot hear you.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Okay, so I can turn off live transcript then.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Do I need to make you co host.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Speaker:  I can tell you which --

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:42.000
I can tell you which breakout rooms those are.  Give me a second.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
We need the captionist in breakout room 4, when we do breakout rooms

00:15:46.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And the interpret in room 5

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Speaker:  You know what, are you sure those only those two students?

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Speaker:  Those were the two who requested.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.000
So if there's not a 3rd student, then we don't need --

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Do we need an interpret in the captioned room?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
We only had a request from Roshon?  Do you want an interpret in realm 4?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Room?

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Just the captioning?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Okay, thank you.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Speaker:  I don't mind stepping out if one is not ncsry

00:17:49.000 --> 00:18:05.000
are you familiar with UX stuff?

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
does that change things?  Do you think?

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.000
I don't know, I thought that was department policy.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:47.000
I know that's the general -- really, it's up to you

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Speaker:  We were already assigned.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:18:53.000

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:14.000

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Speaker:  Sounds good.  That will help you get used to it.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Right. Okay, I'll take care of it. I'll read the email and have a good assignment. The two of you. Thank you, and I'll communicate. Okay.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:48.000
So, Let me ask Sean Do you see captions.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
If you can see captions I'll just proceed but if you can't.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:04.000

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Okay, welcome everyone.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:04.000
That is to say you have a contribution to make to your team

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:32.000
I wanted to start by just saying that I'm an old saying that I've often heard is that all of us know more than any of us.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:13.000

Right. And then, Deborah Hughes. Hi everyone, I'm the HR person at RCN I've only been there for months but, um, we're always looking for ways to update ourselves and show our brand and make our presence known and I think things like this will actually

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:51.000
really help us expand, just to touch other people along with just contacting and reaching out to the current parents and staff.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Speaker:  Thank you so much, the head of Rochester Greenovation is sick, and we don't have a replacement for her

I'll be going through these two slideshows next

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Okay, great. Thank you so much. Now, the head of Rochester green innovation is sick, and we didn't get a replacement for her so she's not here.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Today we just found out that she was sick today.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:15.000
The Rochester Child First and the Greenovation slideshow

00:26:15.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Jeff and Debora will be able to do Q&A

00:25:48.000 --> 00:26:18.000
And so none of the volunteers have been able to replace her. I'll be going through these two slideshows Next, the Rochester child first and the Rochester green innovation slideshow and Jeff and Deborah will probably be able to do q amp a on this.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Our time is running a little late, so I'm going to turn it on

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
You can go in and follow along if you want

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:07.000
I'm going to fullscreen that

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Our time is running a little bit late, we are supposed to be halfway through this Rochester child first presentation right now. So I'm going to turn it on.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:39.000
And you can also go into it and follow along if you want I'm going to just full screen that.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:46.000
You can navigate through the slideshow if I'm going too fast

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Just using the arrow keys to nvgte

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Okay, so as was mentioned

00:26:30.000 --> 00:27:00.000

Innovative services to children

00:27:10.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Their main facility is this in the south wedge

00:26:45.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Okay, so as, as was mentioned, Rochester child first is a not for profit agency dedicated to advancing the quality of early education here in western New York through leadership, advocacy and innovative services to children.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Their main facility is this four acre location in the south wedge.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Parents drop off and pick up children, it's a mad house in these times so an app would be welcome

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Parents converge on this location every day at 9am and 3pm to drop off and pick up children and it is a madhouse at these times. So an app to help manage drop off and pick up would be welcomed

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:24.000
And the childcare providers have the autonomy to use or reject apps that appeal or don't to them

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:31.000
And the childcare providers that are see and have the autonomy to use or reject apps that appeal or don't appeal to them.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:40.000
There is currently an employee shortage so also an app that would help recruit childcare providers would be welcomed

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:52.000
the current use of technology.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:44.000
The current use of technology is --

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Sorry.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Sorry, did someone say something?

00:28:03.000 --> 00:27:46.000
I'm getting a few people not muted and one is talking in the background

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000
It's somebody say something.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:06.000
I'm getting a few people have are not muted.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Let me know if you want to talk

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:14.000
And I think one of them is talking in the background but I'm not sure.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
I can see the participant list even though I have the screen share on

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
I can see you raise your hand

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Feel free to jump in

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:02.000
The providers seem reluctant to use Facebook

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:32.000
But let me know if you want to talk I mean I can see the participant list here even though I have the, the screen share on, so I can see raise your hand or feel free to jump in at any time.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Class dojo is not a way of two way communication

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:18.000
So apps with that would be welcome

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:44.000
So, the providers are seen reluctant to use Facebook the parents don't use Twitter much in class dojo and other education app is helpful but not a thorough source of two way communication.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Most parents have smart phones

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:30.000
You could replicate some functions of social media in your app and that would be welcome

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:42.000
So apps that have, you know, some two way communication, could be welcome, and most parents have smartphones so even an app that allows us to text them all at once might help.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:29:03.000
So you could actually replicate some of the functions of social media in your app. And, and that would potentially be welcome

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Important challenges to make an app open to parents but not predators

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:16.000
There are different audiences for an app

00:29:16.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Parents for picking up might want to say they're late or on their way

00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:11.000
and important challenges to make an app that's open to parents but not open to predators potential predators. So there are different audiences for an app, parents, for picking up they might want to be able to say that they might be late.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Or they might want to say I'm on my way.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:31.000
And for parents to communicate with teachers about what their children are dg

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Managers knowing who to approach regarding late paymns

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:44.000
And for parents to communicate with teachers about what their children are doing right now.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Or who may need timely messages about fundraises, the mad hatter tea party

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Childcare providers want to communicate with parents

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:35.000
manager would like to know which parents they need to approach during the 3pm crush regarding late payments prospective parents and prospective donors may need info that's on the website but delivered differently, or who may need timely messages about

00:29:35.000 --> 00:30:00.000
fundraisers raffles silent auctions Casino Night, and the Mad Hatter tea party which were fundraising activities that they do.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
It may be hard particularly now during the pandemic

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
So an app reaching out to recruits could be valuable

00:30:09.000 --> 00:29:44.000
There are some things that are really important to them

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:54.000
And the childcare providers may want to communicate with parents, and it can be hard to reach prospective employees particularly now during the pandemic.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:17.000
So, an app that that reaches out to potential recruits could be valuable.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:26.000
It must be inclusive of different races, ethnicities and abilities

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:03.000
There are child focused apps that are too cartoonish

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Now there are some things that are really important to them that are really important are seeing that surface when we talk. It must be inclusive of different races, ethnicities and abilities.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:15.000
That don't indicate the people behind them are professionals

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:42.000
It must communicate that we're professionals, there are a lot of child focused apps that are two cartoonish in appearance and don't communicate that the people behind them are really professionals.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Even the faccebook group was a tough sell, so something that is blindingly easy

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Could be a great benefit

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:34.000
And of course an app must be easy for people who are not computer savvy, even the Facebook group was a tough sell.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:54.000
So something that's just blindingly easy.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Those are all the slides I have, what questions do you have about RCN?

00:30:39.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Could be a great benefit.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Speaker:  I hope everyone can hear me fine

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:54.000
Okay, so those are all the slides that I have, what kinds of questions do you have about RCN

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
myself.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:13.000
Yeah.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Does RCN have anyone like customers we could interview or ask questions for?

00:31:16.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Or do testing with?

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Alright, I hope everyone can hear me fine my microphone has been having several issues this week. I hear you just fine. Perfect.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Speaker:  Yes, we could set you up, it would just ba matter of -- we're closed on /mon

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Does RCN have anyone, any like customers we could interview an hour or ask for questions for or do any kind of testing with.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
So getting to someone on Tuesday or Wednesday

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:16.000
A parent or teachers

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Um, yes we could set you up I mean it would just be a matter of, you know, we're closed on Monday, so it'd be better getting to somebody, you know Tuesday or Wednesday, you know, a parent or some teachers.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
If you have my contact information which is jhoffman4@kids.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
I could facilitate that

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Speaker:  Thanks for the offer, though

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Speaker:  Thank you!

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:47.000
If you have my contact information, which is just Jay Hoffman at RCM for the number for kids that orgy yeah should be able to facilitate that. It just, it would be a real short timeline.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Alright, thanks so much for the offer though.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:32:03.000
I'll thank you.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Speaker:  Someone has put it in

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Just jhoffman

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:17.000
There you go, yes

00:32:17.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Speaker:  I put it wrong I spelled kids wrong!

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Oh, somebody has already put it in, but I think it's Jay Hoffman not Jeff Hoffman isn't it correct Jay Hoffman.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:23.000
There you go. Yes.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Can I edit

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:11.000
No I can't

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:27.000
I put it, I put kids spelled kids wrong.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:36.000
And I can't delete it

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:17.000
My email program won't understand it but someone might

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
No, I can't even edit it.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
I can't edit it and I can't delete it.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:41.000
I think gigs is close enough.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:29.000
A couple more people have hands up

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:56.000
My email program won't understand it but someone might. Okay, a couple of questions, a couple of more people have their hands up Matt has his hand up.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Speaker:  You mentioned the child pick up and drop off is a hectic scenario, is there anything else that comes to mind?

00:32:38.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Oh, yeah. Um, I guess my question is, other than you mentioned that the child pick up and drop off is one of the more hectic

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Your biggest challenge at the moment other than that?

00:33:06.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Speaker:  Feel free to jump in, Deb

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:58.000
scenarios that you guys have Is there anything else that comes to mind with one of your like biggest challenges, at the moment, other than that.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:17.000
And feel free to jump in. As I'm as I'm trying to think of things in it.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:24.000
This technology is a challenge just in the sense that we have a lot of lower income parents

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Most if not all have a smart phone, but

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:31.000
You know the technology, I think, is a challenge, Justin says most of our parents, you know we have a lot of lower income parents and most of them if not all of them would would have a smartphone or or, you know, some kind of connection, you know, they

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:41.000
A lot, I don't think have a home computer or even a tablet or laptop

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:47.000
So I think that's part of what we want to be able to reach all of our parents

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:21.000
That might not be a deal with perspective emplyess

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:51.000
could get through their phone, but a lot. I don't think, you know, have a home computer or even have a tablet or a laptop so that, you know, I think that's part of what we want to be able to to reach all of our parents, that might not be such a big issue

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Can you think of anything else, deb?

00:33:38.000 --> 00:34:02.000
with prospective employees.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Speaker:  COVID gave us challenges we've never seen being

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Before

00:34:11.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Closing classrooms, things we want to get out

00:33:42.000 --> 00:34:12.000
Gosh, can you think of anything else really pressing dad that comes up on a regular basis. Well I think Paul that gave us challenges that we've never had before so I think just quick communication meaning, you know, um, you know, a surge, or closing certain

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Not an email they can't read until night time

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:00.000
So something we can do mass communications they can get on their phone

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:28.000
classrooms or, you know, things like that that we want to get out that's gotta be not like an email that they might read or they might not till like night time.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Before they even get the kids dressed

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:34.000
So something that we can do Mass Communications very very easily and quickly that they will get on their phone. So before they even get the kids dressed.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
COVID gave us additional challenges

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:20.000
Speaker:  Yeah the way amber alerts work

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:50.000
You know what I mean that it's going to pop up on their phone nice and easy and us not having to like text a million people and that kind of thing so Koba definitely gave us additional challenges.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:30.000
It's nothing as extreme as that, but a notification system that doesn't even have an interface/

00:34:30.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Yeah, the thing that comes to mind when you mentioned that is the way that amber alerts work I know it's nothing as extreme as that but something. Would you say that something as simple as like a notification system with maybe doesn't even have like an

00:35:01.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Speaker:  The difference is we usually communicate not just we're closed due to

00:34:43.000 --> 00:35:11.000
interface for them to use would be a useful thing just something or just like a notification pops up on their phone for like emergency communications and things like that, well, so the difference I would say is, we usually communicate.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:18.000
We give a bit more information because there's more information than just a quick alert

00:35:18.000 --> 00:34:55.000
It's more so a communication -- a conversation

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:23.000
I'm not just we're closed due to, like, we give a little bit more information because usually when you're dealing with children and our staff, there's more information than just a quick alert that were closed or don't bring your kid today kind of thing

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.000
So it's not a quick alert

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000
That would be great but it's a little more than that

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
We want to service our employees and parents

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Does that make sense?

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:41.000
it's more so, a communication, a conversation. Do you know what I mean. So it's not just a quick alert, I would, I mean that would be great. But I think it's it's a little bit more than that because we actually want to service our employees and our parents,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Because if we just say we're closed because of COVID that's alarming!

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Does that make sense?

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Something like two way communication

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:59.000
more than just an alert. Does that make sense because if you say we're close to Kovac, that's an alarming. We don't want to alarm them we want to inform them.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Yeah because if anyone has questions we want to shut down assumptions or someone being uneasy about things

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
We want to respond quickly

00:36:12.000 --> 00:35:40.000
And as I recruit, indeed is great

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Does that makes sense, something, something with the functionality of like a two way communication. Yeah, because if anybody has questions we definitely want to shut down any, you know, assumptions and or, you know, somebody being, you know, uneasy about

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000
things we definitely want to respond quickly.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
That makes sense.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:20.000
And I think to just recruiting, as I recruit, I mean indeed is great.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:32.000
But we could reach different groups of people if we had a platform to do so

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
I don't know what that looks like, we're looking at all different age groups and levels of tech savvy people

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Versus still with a flip phone

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:09.000
But recruiting is always a struggle

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:29.000
But I think we could probably reach different groups of people, if we had a platform to do so and I don't really know what that looks like. I mean, we're looking at all different age groups, all different levels of, you know, tech savvy people versus

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:39.000
still with a flip phone. So I don't really know what that looks like. But recruiting is always a struggle, always a struggle.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Okay, cool.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Mathew, did we finish answering your question?

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Yes thank you

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Alex?

00:37:05.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Speaker:  You mentioned the pick up and drop off times are always really crazy?

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Alex has a hand up, or I'm sorry Matthew did we finish answering your question.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Yes, thank you, Alex has a hand up.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Yes, for the most part

00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:11.000
So, I'm remembering correctly you mentioned that the pickup and drop off times are always really crazy.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:18.000
So --

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:02.000
The thing with drop off and pick up is due to c19

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Oh yes, for the most part, yes.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:27.000
So,

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:35.000
We can't have 15 parents coming into the building at 3 o-clock

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:11.000
So many times parents are standing outside versus

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:41.000
so the thing was drop off and pick up and that is due to coven, we can have, you know, 15 parents coming at three o'clock and coming into the building, we can't we can't accommodate that.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
If they could message us and message them when they can come to the door for their child

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.000
Versus having people stand outside

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Because all parents are coming to pick up

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:43.000
So many times parents are standing outside versus if they could message us and we could message them on a platform that says okay we're going to bring your child up to the door will will let you know when you can come to the door, versus having people

00:37:43.000 --> 00:38:03.000
stand outside because we can only have so many people in the four year because it's very small and all parents are coming at three o'clock to pick up their kid or dropping off.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
You know like when you go to the doctor and you get a text that you can or can't come in

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
Something like that would be helpful

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Again, it's due to COVID

00:38:13.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Good to know

00:37:52.000 --> 00:38:22.000
So I think something that you know like when you go to the doctors and you get a text that you can come in or you can't come in whatever the case may be something, some something like that would be helpful, and then again is due to coven.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
We're open from 7 to 530 but the crunch times are that

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
The other issue that comes up is

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Identification in the sense that we

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Right. Good to know. Yeah, and I think also with. We're open from, you know, basically from seven in the morning till 530 but for before and after care but the crunch times are really that.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
We have a child and both mother and father are on the list

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:50.000
But they send grandma

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000
But we don't know grandma and can't hand a child off to grandma

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Just because she says so

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:39.000
The other issue that comes up sometime during the crunch time is identification, in the sense that we, you know, we have a child and both mother and father are on our list and pick them up, but mom and dad couldn't show up today.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:57.000
And they said, Grandma, well we don't know grandma.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Even if the child recognizes a person

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
That goes back to an issue about this being accessible

00:39:10.000 --> 00:38:42.000
But it needs to be protected information also

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:55.000
And we can't hear the child off to grandma just because just because she says, you know, so even if the child seems to, you know, recognize the person.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:18.000
So I think that goes back to to mix issue about this needs to be accessible but it also needs to be, you know, protected information so not just anybody can get access to it.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Alex says he has a follow up question that he's going to type in

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Okay. Good to know.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:29.000
Because his roommate is talking

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:10.000
-- I'm doing that now

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Now Alex says he has a follow up question that he's going to type in because his roommate is talking.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:37.000
After that, we have

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Mesha and

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Both have questions

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:28.000
So Alex did you want to type in your follow up question or oh yeah I'm doing that now sorry. Okay.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:48.000
So after that we have measure and show busy both have questions.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:40:04.000
. . .

00:40:04.000 --> 00:39:55.000
maybe we could take Mesha's question while we're waiting

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Maybe we can take measures question while we're waiting.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Speaker:  My question is with the notifications you're thinking,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:01.000
Are you thinking of a single person in the office sending these?

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:26.000
So, my question is, with the, with the notification you guys are big enough for the, for the app.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Or the teacher would have access to their own section

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Are you thinking of having just one single person maybe somebody who works in the office sending out these sort of messages or any updates on the child Are you thinking, the teacher would have access to sort of their own idea of the platform or their

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
How do you guys do that now or how are you thinking of having that look?

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Speaker:  Good question I honestly don't know

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:20.000
That is a great question,

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:44.000
own section of the platform and and they'll have like their class lists, and like, and that's sort of what so how do you guys do that on your end now and then the power you thinking about that look

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:33.000
When kids are picked up at 3

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000
good question. I honestly don't know.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Yeah, there is a great question.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000
In the afternoon, a lot of time

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000
The teacher will help out with that

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
They know Johnny's parents come at

00:41:01.000 --> 00:40:39.000
305 or 310

00:40:39.000 --> 00:41:09.000
When kids especially when kids are picked up at three o'clock in the afternoon. A lot of times the, the teacher will help out with that mean they know that, you know, Johnny's parents always come at 305 or 310.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000
But I think at the end of the day we would want someone in the front office to okay

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.000
Everytime a child is coming and going

00:41:19.000 --> 00:40:55.000
I'm not sure we'd want a teacher to say

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:24.000
But still it at the end of the day, I think we would want someone in the front office to actually okay you know every time, every time a child is coming and going.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Your parent is here

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
You can leave now

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Does that get to the point of your question?

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Yeah, I think I get what you're saying

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:41.000
parents here, you know you can leave now. And then the front office not know that their childhood left there's that kind of wishes that kind of get to the, the point of your question.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Sort of like a solution if the app is

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:29.000
If the teacher has to check off and that would update for whoever is in the front offce

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Yeah, I think I'd be reaching just sort of one, just think about when I was in school and like sort of attendance tracking but just thinking of like sort of a solution if the app is the teacher would have to accept check off this student is leaving on

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Is that feasible?

00:41:41.000 --> 00:42:02.000
the app and then that would be that would like update automatically in the system for whoever's in the front office would that be feasible solution.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000
I think that would be a good check and balance

00:42:08.000 --> 00:41:51.000
So that we can all see an active document of data

00:41:51.000 --> 00:42:18.000
I think that actually would be a very good check and balance on our end, so that the office the teacher everybody's on the same page and we can all see it as a live.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:27.000
and if there are issues are problems we could see

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Immediately and not walk across the building to see a child

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Um, you know, active document of data, do you know what I mean so that we can actually know at any given point a snapshot of who's here who's been picked up.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:31.000
And if there are any issues or problems we would be able to see it immediately and not have to like walk clear across the building to see a child or whatever you know what I mean.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Great, Alex put his question in

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Yeah. Okay.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:48.000
[Reading from chat]

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:25.000
Speaker:  Well it has to be staggered

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Okay, great. So Alex put his question so at those punch times with that doctor's office two way communication style be preferable to say, parents being able to schedule staggered pick off pickup dropoff times as the example solution that came to mind.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:56.000
So the answer would be yes

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Although some get there early or late

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000
What happens is parents can't go into the classrooms anymore

00:43:07.000 --> 00:42:43.000
We have greeters that when

00:42:43.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Well, it has to be staggered so the answer would be yes. Um, although pickup time three o'clock, some get there a few minutes early some get there a few minutes late so they could let us know they're outside, we could.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Someone comes to pick up a child

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
They go back to the classroom and walk the child up front

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Due to c19

00:43:22.000 --> 00:42:56.000
If the parent would say

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:26.000
So what happens is his parents can't go into the classrooms anymore they only go to the front door. And just so you understand we have greeters that when somebody comes to pick up a child at the door, they go back or they call the, the classroom, and

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:37.000
I'm here to pick up such and sc

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:10.000
There's a check and balance that the greeter would

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:22.000
they walk the child up front. So before the parents would just walk into the classroom and grab their child to decode it we can't do that. So if the parent would say, I'm here to pick up such and such.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:45.000
There's a check and balance that the child is supposed to go with that person. And then the greeter would go and get the child and bring him to the door then the parent would be notified that the child's ready at the door.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Pick up the child and let the parent know they're there

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Does that answer your question?

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:35.000
Yeah, I think so

00:43:35.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Does that answer your question or no.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
You would rather have the parent say they're here rather than saying this group is at

00:44:06.000 --> 00:43:39.000
255 or this class is at 258

00:43:39.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Um, I think so. So you'd rather have parents just be able to say, Oh, I'm, I'm here, and then they come in, in, like, the order that they come in but slowly, rather than oh this group of parents is to 55 this group is like 258, this group and we wouldn't

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Yeah, we're trying to be feasible to the parents

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
So

00:44:18.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Staggered, I don't think that works

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:26.000
do that, we wouldn't do that so we're, we're trying to be very serviceable to the parents and, and it is a three o'clock pick up, like, and it is a nine o'clock drop off, just like school you know i mean you wouldn't like classrooms if you're going into

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000
I think just whoever comes first come first served

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.000
We can't have --

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:10.000
I don't want everyone standing in 90 degree heat

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:40.000
class starts at a certain time and ends at a certain time still staggered, I don't, I don't necessarily think that works.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Or 10 degree weather standing outside

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:44.000
I think just whoever comes first come first serve and you're in a list and we'll get your child as soon as we can, but we just can't have every, I don't want everyone standing in 90 degree heat or, you know, 10 degree weather outside because they walk

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:50.000
This might be a completely separate app

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:34.000
But those are the main pick up drop off times

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:59.000
up to the building and we still have to go get their child.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:44:38.000
But we will still have kids here until 530 for after school care

00:44:38.000 --> 00:45:08.000
This might be a completely separate FL so it's a great question. But those are the main pickup dropoff times but we will still have kids here till you know, 435 o'clock 534 after school care.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:44:54.000
So there might be functionality that a parent of one of those kids texts us they'll be there in 5 minutes

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:06.000
So there might be some kind of functionality about, you know, hey I'm you know at five o'clock, that a parent of one of those kids could text us and say I'll be there in five minutes.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:21.000
They could be helpful.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
We are focusing on our crunch times but that

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Could be helpful

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:31.000
We're focusing on our crunch times of nine to three but that you know for some parents that that could be helpful to say I'm coming to 430 I'm coming at five o'clock.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:37.000
She couldn't raise her hand in zoom but has a q

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Hello, am I audible?

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:20.000
I have two questions, the first was that you mentioned the app should reflect professionals and not too childish

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:29.000
Okay, cool. So she has a question. She couldn't raise your hand and in zoom for some reason, but she has a question.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Hello, Amanda. Yes.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
But is there any brand you would like us to integrate into the app?

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:06.000
For any visuals that are on there

00:46:06.000 --> 00:45:32.000
We would share the RCN logo, the green and white logo

00:45:32.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Yeah, hi, um, I have two questions. The first was that you had mentioned that the app should reflect that you're professionals, and it shouldn't be too childish but is there any particular team or brand that you would like us to integrate into the app.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000
For any visible interface

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000
That would be wonderful

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
We don't want busy

00:46:20.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Not cartoonish stuff

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:06.000
You know, for any for any visuals that are that are on there yeah we would share the, the RCM logo our green and white RCN logo for any kind of, you know, visible interface.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Yeah, that would that would be wonderful.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Not busy, very simple and very user friendly

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Is there any color palette you guys have in mind that we should follow?

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Yes, and if I can find that on Tuesday I will shoot it over

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Okay, I certainly don't want busy. Do you know what I mean so like, not just cartoonish kind of stuff but we don't want busy. Very, Very simple, very user friendly.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Is there any color palette that you guys have in mind for us to use, or that we should follow so that it sticks to your brand.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000
I'll put it on the website if you do that

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:59.000
And I'll message everyone

00:46:59.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Okay, yeah because the green you're looking at is a spiceful green number

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Yes. And if I can, if I can find it on Tuesday I'll shoot it over to Mick yeah we have on the website if you if you do that.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:47:04.000
I'm sorry. I'll put it on the website if you do that and I'll message everyone.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.000
I forget what the number is

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000
But we do have a specific color palette

00:47:12.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Keep in mind

00:46:50.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Okay. Yeah, because that the green you're looking at is a specific green number data Donna, I forget what the number is but yeah we do, we do have a very specific color palette.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000
We want our app to be identifiable so that if they have 30 apps on their phone

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
That ours is Earlies to identify

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000
It's a go to

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
You know what I mean?

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000
They don't have to look for it

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:05.000
It's idtnfb

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Keep in mind for anybody that is an app person. We want our app to be very identifiable so you know if they have 30 apps on their phone for the people that are more smartphone savvy that ours is is very easy to identify whether it be our logo or something

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Okay,

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:31.000
else but that it's, it's a go to United mean they don't have to like, look for it, it's very identifiable.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Okay.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
The other one is you wanted the app to be inclusive

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:55.000
Of ethnicities

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.000
So is there something specific about any accessibility issue you want us to target?

00:47:59.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Could we have it in English and Spanish?

00:47:34.000 --> 00:48:03.000
The other one was that you wanted the app to be inclusive of ethnicities, and also ability so if there's something specific about, like any accessibility issues that you want us to target.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000
I know I'm reaching, but

00:48:07.000 --> 00:47:54.000
-- I was thinking along the lines of

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:14.000
We have it in English and Spanish.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Should we be focusing on a color palette

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:28.000
That is helpful for a color blind individual

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000
And should we be concerned about being blind friendly in any way?

00:48:31.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Wow, that would be amazing

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Okay, I know I'm reaching but I was thinking along the lines of, should we be focusing on color palette that's also helpful for colorblind individuals, and it should be concerned about being blind flat friendly as well.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:44.000
I'm not sure how it would operate

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:53.000
I know we have had a couple parents who are deaf, but --

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000
That's an interesting question about whether it's verbal for people who are blind

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:26.000
I don't know

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:56.000
Wow. That would be amazing. I'm not sure how they would operate. I know we have had a couple parents who are deaf, but, oh gosh I.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Deb what do you think about that one?

00:49:02.000 --> 00:48:42.000
I don't know if this is the right way to say it

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:50.000
That's a really interesting question about you know it you know whether it was verbal or whatever for people who are are blind.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000
I don't know Deb, what do you what do you think about that one.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:06.000
I think.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:14.000
I think it would be nice if we could

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
But it's not at the top of my wishlist, does that make sense?

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Yeah, I agree

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:08.000
Plus, not to focus on one thing

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:27.000
Does that make sense.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:11.000
But if we're going to the rush times of pick up and drop off

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Yep. Yeah, I agree and plus, you know, not to focus on one thing but if we're going to the rush times of pickup and drop off.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Those are sighted people here to pick up their kids

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Those are, you know, those are cited people who typically are driving here to pick up their kids.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
But I do know that we have people who translate in Spanish for parents and employeeless

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Employees

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:27.000
So if we could put that in the app that would touch a whole group of individuals

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:57.000
But I do know that we do have people that translate in Spanish for some of our parents and families, and even employees so if there was a selection to do the app in English or Spanish.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Whether that's for recruiting purposes

00:49:41.000 --> 00:50:06.000
I think that would touch a whole different group of individuals, whether it be for recruiting purposes, or just communication that's clear for people that aren't as good with English.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:13.000
-- great

00:50:13.000 --> 00:49:56.000
It looks like another Mathew has another question

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.000
Absolutely, yeah the Spanish could be very important for us.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:24.000
Okay, thank you.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Hello, as far as content words or media, etc.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Are we providing placeholders for that

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:03.000
Or the media or the content?

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Great. So, um, it looks like another Matthew, has another question Matthew in Cardona Hello again, um, as far as a copy or any kind of, you know, content words media etc.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:39.000
are we providing placeholders for that or are you going to be providing you know the media or the content.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.000
I would think that you're going to provide placeholders for them

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000
I don't think they're going to have time to do that

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.000
I think that would make sense, I would agree

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:32.000
I guess my concept of placeholders is

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:58.000
I would think that you're, you're going to provide place.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:38.000
Once we have the app and be available

00:50:38.000 --> 00:51:02.000
I don't think that they're going to have time to do that. Personally, I think that would make sense. Yeah, I would agree and it's.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:08.000
We could create standardized messages

00:51:08.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Whether it's closing early today for snow or weather

00:50:47.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Yeah, I guess my concept of placeholders is once we have the app and be available and we could, you know, we could create standardized messages about.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000
I think you're right it would be placeholders and text

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Perfect for that situation

00:51:26.000 --> 00:50:58.000
I noticed there are some people here who are not registered and are on the call

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:13.000
We're closing early today because of snow or whether or you know whatever but yeah I think you're right that it will be placeholders and not perfect specific text for every situation.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Okay, thank you.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.000
I'm wondering if there people who want to participate who didn't get to register

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:45.000
I'm seeing unfamiliar names

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:16.000
It could be that some people use mlptle names

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Okay now, I noticed that there are some people in here who are not registered who are on the call. And I'm wondering if there are people who wanted to participate in the design jam, who didn't get to register.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Because I'm seeing a couple of unfamiliar names.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:57.000
If you haven't registered for this I want you to message me in the chat

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.000
And Mesha has another question

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000
[Reading from chat]

00:52:04.000 --> 00:51:36.000
I think --

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Now it could be some people use multiple names so that that could be it but if you haven't registered for this, I want you to at least message me in the chat

00:51:51.000 --> 00:52:14.000
and mesh as another question which is how detailed Are you looking for all this to be what do you hope to see visually, to help get an understanding of the overall app.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:24.000
There's probably a happy medium that they're going to be looking for in terms of detail

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000
There's a degree of detail that would be too much

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:01.000
And then too sketchy

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:30.000
And I think there's probably a happy medium that we're that they're going to be looking for in terms of detail that you know there's a degree of detail that will become inflexible that would be too much.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000
I guess would be --

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Let me --

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000
yeah

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:18.000
Let me answer your question with a q

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:43.000
And then there's too sketchy. So my guess. You guys may want to answer that, but I guess would be,

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Whichever design chosen or the winner

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:31.000
If we knew who the student was who did that and we're using it for weeks or months,

00:52:31.000 --> 00:53:01.000
let me let me yeah let me answer your question with a question, you know, whichever design, I, you know, would be chosen or would be the winner, you know, if we knew who the person was who who did that the student was a good that and we're using it for

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:08.000
Could we contact that student back and ask to make a change for it

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000
What these students are doing is just design

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:18.000
So they're not usable apps

00:53:18.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Luckily I have a class that builds apps based on designs

00:52:47.000 --> 00:53:01.000
a couple weeks or a month, and then could, you know, can we contact that student back and say hey could you could you make this change to it, or you know what would that be reasonable request or not.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Well what these students are doing.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:24.000
Those are not usable at. Okay, Okay. OK, design, design.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:30.000
And we built that based on last year's

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000
So those would be students that you might want to contact

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:09.000
I'm going to contact them anyway

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:20.000
So luckily I happen to have a class that builds apps, based on designs and we've actually built.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:42.000
So those would be students that you might want to contact.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:48.000
But if you were using the app and wanted to tweak it

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.000
It's the implementers you want to contact

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:24.000
Or we might all get in the same realm together

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Or I mean I'm actually going to contact them anyway. But there's students, if you were, if you were using the app and wanted to tweak it.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:56.000
It's the implements that you would probably talk to and then the implementation like

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:42.000
Okay, so let me go on

00:53:42.000 --> 00:54:00.000
okay thanks for we all get in the same room together at the same time I don't know.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.000
I don't see any other questions

00:54:04.000 --> 00:53:51.000
I want to go on to the other sldhow

00:53:51.000 --> 00:54:13.000
Okay, so let me go on to the other.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:53:55.000
So we don't have a representative from Rochester Greenovation

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:24.000
I don't see any other questions here. So I want to go on to the other slideshow so we don't have a representative from Rochester green innovation, but I have a few things to say about it.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.000
It's completely volunteer run in a store downturn

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:08.000
Downtown

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:36.000
Rochester, green innovation is completely volunteer run, and they run a store downtown at 850 St Paul street, and it is an 18,000 square foot facility.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:41.000
They also have an eBay store and Poshmark store

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:47.000
But these only show a selection of items

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:23.000
They have a fragmented online prescience

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:49.000
They also have an eBay store and a posh Mark store, but these are run by volunteers with limited time. And these stores only show a few items they have a vast collection of items in their 18,000 foot.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:36.000
Presence

00:54:36.000 --> 00:55:00.000
18,000 square foot space.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.000
They have different volunteers that run nonintegrated presences

00:55:04.000 --> 00:54:40.000
Facebook is the first hit when I google

00:54:40.000 --> 00:55:07.000
And they haven't fragmented online presence so they have different volunteers who separately. Run, you know, non integrated Facebook, Instagram and tick tock presences.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Rochester Greenovation

00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:13.000
Facebook is the first hit when I google Rochester green innovation.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:20.000
Instagram and TikTok don't come up

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:24.000
They are first on a yelp search for Rochester thrift store

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:00.000
But not Rochester second hand

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:17.000
Rochester green innovation has a website that's not to maintain that comes up seven, Instagram and tick tock, don't come up on a search. They are first on a Yelp search for Rochester thrift store, but they don't appear on the first page of Rochester second

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:29.000
hand.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:35.000
These are images from their Facebook page

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:42.000
They have 30% of traffic coming from Facebook

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:19.000
Probably because Facebook is the most currently up to date page

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:46.000
So they have, and these are images from their Facebook page.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:50.000
It's the most well maintained

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Then Instagram and walk-ins

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:26.000
People who google, new to the area

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:36.000
They have different kinds of traffic they have 30% of their traffic coming from Facebook. 15% coming from, and that's probably because Facebook is the most.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:56:03.000
Currently, up to date.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Then a whipping 30% they don't know where they come from

00:55:42.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Page it's the most well maintained page, then Instagram then walk ins without social media people who, Google, people who are new to the area, people who just look up secondhand stores in Rochester, and then a whopping 30% that they don't know where they

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.000
A typical visit could last from 30 minutes --

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:19.000
There's so much stuff

00:56:19.000 --> 00:55:57.000
Frequently they have people who stay for 3 hours

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:24.000
come from.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000
I'm not a big shopper so that number floored me

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
They have several different kinds of shapers

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Shoppers

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:01.000
People who love thrifting

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:18.000
And a typical visit can last from 30 minutes so you need 30 minutes to cover the place because there's so much stuff and frequently they have visitors who stay for three hours, believe it or not, I'm not really a big shopper so that that number really

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000
floored me.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:43.000
And they have several different kinds of visitors, they have people who are just looking around, people who love drifting people who are looking for something in particular, such as a desk or a couch or a table.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.000
People who just want to buy and resell things

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:30.000
And then just people who are looking for deals

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:40.000
They have slumlords coming into furnished apartments resellers and flippers who just want to buy things and resell them on more organized sites.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:56.000
And then there are just people who are looking for deals, if, if they can find a bargain they're happy.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:02.000
The inventory is kept very smply

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:08.000
Here are some examples of categories

00:57:08.000 --> 00:56:49.000
They have a total of about 50 of these things

00:56:49.000 --> 00:57:15.000
The inventory is kept very simply, everything is just recorded as being one of 50 categories.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.000
An app that allows you to assign tag of photographs

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.000
That are tags of these 50 types

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:26.000
Might be advantageous

00:57:26.000 --> 00:56:55.000
The volunteers are pressed for time

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:14.000
And here are some examples of categories and their biggest category is miscellaneous, and they have a total of about 50 of these things. And it occurs to me that, you know, an app that allows you to assign tags to photographs that are tags of these 50

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:33.000
types might be really advantageous for them.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.000
A couple volunteers have no tech at all

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.000
Some have a set schedule and some

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Pop in when they feel like it

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:49.000
The volunteers are always pressed for time most of the volunteers communicate through texts and phone calls, but there are a couple of volunteers who have no tech at all.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:29.000
There are five agencies in Rochester that help mentally challenged people find work

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:58.000
Most of the volunteers have a set schedule but some just pop into the store whenever they feel like it, and green innovation also works. Agencies there about five agencies in Rochester, that help mentally challenged adults find work, and their clients

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000
There is a network of communication with the agencies that

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:06.000
Liaison with them

00:58:06.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Then if Greenovation has to close for an emrgncy

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000
volunteer at Green innovation to prep for paying jobs.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:58.000
And those are our volunteers and there, there is a network of communication with the agencies that

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:09.000
liaison with them.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:16.000
Which they did in /oct

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:23.000
They have to make 25 calls to --

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:00.000
That's the population of their universe of immediate contacts

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:27.000
And then if renovation has to close for any emergency which they did in October.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:05.000
There are a lot of design opportunities

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:33.000
They have to make about 25 phone calls and texts to volunteers and agencies. So that's kind of the population of their, their universe of immediate contacts.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.000
It may be the case an app works better because most people are

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.000
Physically in the store

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:21.000
And they would be able to use it on their phones

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:46.000
So there are a lot of design opportunities it may very well be the case that an app is going to work better than a website because most people are physically in the store.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Photos are a big deal

00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:00.000
An app that encourages people to post and review merchandise

00:59:00.000 --> 00:58:33.000
Might work better than Instagram and TikTok

00:58:33.000 --> 00:59:03.000
When they're concerned about the store and they would be able to use it on their phones.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Communication is a big thing

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:17.000
If there were one place where people could give updates might work better than twitter

00:59:17.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Online incarnations may be highlife

00:58:42.000 --> 00:59:12.000
Photos are really big deal. So an app that encourage people to post and review photos of merchandise. And that was usable by non tech savvy shoppers might work better than Instagram or Tick tock, communication is a big thing for them.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:58:58.000
Helpful

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:26.000
If there was one place that all volunteers and shoppers could trust for the latest updates or give their own updates might work better than Twitter, and a connection to agree innovations many online incarnations may be helpful.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:33.000
An app that had a page

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Just connecting to their Facebook

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:37.000
So many of renovations volunteers and clients don't know about all the different things that volunteers are up to.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:41.000
Instagram, TikTok, might be useful

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:23.000
So that's all I have on Greenovation

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:46.000
So an app that had a page just connecting to their Facebook their,

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.000
I might say one thing that I think is imp

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:53.000
Which is that

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:31.000
They're not looking for an e-commerce app

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:34.000
their Instagram their tech talk and so on.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:59.000
might be useful.

00:59:59.000 --> 00:59:37.000
I don't think they would be able to support an e-commerce app

00:59:37.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Okay, so that's all I have on green innovation, I might I might say one thing that I think is really important, which is that they're not looking for an e commerce app.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I think they're looking for something simpler than that

01:00:12.000 --> 00:59:53.000
And I think this is kind of a key thing

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:58.000
And I don't think that they would be able to support an e commerce app.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I think they're looking for something much simpler than that.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
This photos thing

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Okay

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Does anyone want to ask --

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I have some knowledge

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000
If anyone wants to ask me questions

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:06.000
I see two people still have hands up

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:30.000
And I think this, you know, this is kind of a key thing this photos thing.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
But I don't know

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:14.000
If k

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Okay. Does anybody want to ask me so I have some knowledge of of Rochester green innovation so if anybody wants to ask me questions.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
It's from before?

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Sorry, no,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:22.000
The other Matthew also has his hand still up

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I see that two people still have their hands up but that may be from before I don't know, Matthew in Cardona.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Did you have a new question.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Sorry no is my hands. Hello.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Yeah, I do have a question

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.000
When you say not an e-commerce app

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
The thing that comes to mind is like

01:01:03.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Offer up

01:00:39.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Yeah. And then the other Matthew also has his hand still awful. Yeah, I do have a question, actually, um, okay.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Like things I want to sell

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:23.000
But they also have categories and images

01:01:23.000 --> 01:00:48.000
So are they just looking for a way to have more categories and more specific ones that people can just browse

01:00:48.000 --> 01:01:18.000
So when you say like, not an e commerce app, the thing that comes to mind. Are these apps out there like offer up where you can post things that you want for sale that you want to sell like if I have like an old item in my house I can put on there and

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
To see if they have a certain item

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Like an inventory type app

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I think that would be useful but I don't think they want more categories

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I can sell it, but they also have categories and they also have a ton of images. So are they just sort of looking for a way to have more category categories and more specific ones that people can just browse to see if they have a certain item, like in

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:51.000
a like almost like a just an inventory type app.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:00.000
If they could get an app that would allow individuals to upload photos of things they see in the store

01:02:00.000 --> 01:01:27.000
So the volunteers would use the appointment.  Update the inventory?

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I think that would be very useful but I don't think that they want more categories, I think, if they could, if, if they could get an app that would allow people would allow individuals, either volunteers or customers to upload photos that they have things

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:15.000
App

01:02:15.000 --> 01:01:46.000
That would be easy to implement if they had this capability

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:58.000
that they see in the store and want to comment on. I think that would be very useful. Okay. And, like so. The volunteers would also would they also use this app to update the inventory when new items come in.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:25.000
That would be a potential possibility.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:31.000
It wouldn't be hard to run that into an inventory system

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
But they don't have a complicated inventory system right now

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Professor, I have a q

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I mean we, that would be pretty easy to implement. If they had this capability to to post and review photos. Yeah, it wouldn't be hard application wise to run that into an inventory system.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Okay, but they don't have a complicated inventory system right now.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:28.000
So in the slide about the volunteers there was a point about

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:51.000
I'm Professor I have a question. Yeah.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000
In the case they have to close for an emergency they would have to make 25 phone calls

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Do we have to make any for this particular case?

01:02:32.000 --> 01:03:02.000
So, and the slide about the volunteers, was, there was a little point about indicates that they have to close for an emergency, they would have to make about 25 phone calls and text volunteers and agencies.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Do they want an open to communicate with one another?

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Announcements or chat would be beneficial

01:03:16.000 --> 01:02:48.000
So a chat thing that would allow them to make announcements

01:02:48.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Do we have to make any anything for this particular case because they want an opera, volunteers can communicate with one another and give an inflammation or eating announcements or chat would probably be very beneficial.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000
And also for volunteers to say

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I'm coming in now or I'm not coming in now

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
A communication channel within the app would be beneficial

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000
As a matter of fact,

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
They should probably have two --

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:10.000
The app should have two levels

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:40.000
So a chat thing that would allow them to to make announcements and also for volunteers to say, you know, I'm coming in now or I can't come in now, a communication channel within the app that everyone who's logged in could see would potentially be very

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Stuff the public can see and then staff that you would have to login to be able to say

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:57.000
beneficial as a matter of fact, one thing that has occurred to me is that they should probably have to the app should have two levels there should be stuff that the public can see without logging in, and then stuff that you would have to login to be able

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Also regarding people posting reviews,

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
able to see.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Yes.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Would the volunteers be working on skimming through them and verifying if they're legitimate or spam?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:18.000
If so, do we need to have --

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Give volunteers some sort of power or central

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Control

01:04:23.000 --> 01:03:49.000
That's a very good idea!

01:03:49.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I'm also recording, people posting reviews and post in general.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:03:56.000
That's something I think would be helpful to implement

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Would the volunteers be working on skimming through them and verifying if they're legitimate or if they're spam in any effect on, and if so, do we need to, you know, have the gift volunteer or some sort of power and control so very good idea that I mean,

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:43.000
something that I think would be very helpful for you to to implement.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:34.000
okay then I saw someone else had a hand up

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Okay and then I saw somebody else had a hand up.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
And Matthew's hand is still up

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I'm sorry

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
I don't have another question

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Okay, so what I'd like to do now

01:04:38.000 --> 01:05:03.000
But they put it down and Matthews hand is still up.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Let me ask if there any general questions before we enter the breakout rooms

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
The idea is that you begin discussing which not for profits you would like to work with

01:05:15.000 --> 01:04:47.000
There is a --

01:04:47.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Oh, I'm sorry I'm, I don't have another question. Okay. All right, so what I'd like to do now so it's so let me ask if there are any general questions before we enter the breakout rooms, we're a little bit late on entering the breakout rooms.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
There is not a thing here --

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Okay, there is --

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Oh, no

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Did I really leave this out?

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:19.000
The idea is that you begin discussing, which, not for profits you would like to work with. And there is a

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.000
there is not a thing here.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Okay, there is no.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
There's a page where I would like each team to put in what you want to --

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Who you want to work with

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I'll have to put that in the chat because for some reason I didn't put in on the website

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Did I really leave this out. So there's a call tricks page where I would like each team to put in what you want to who you want to work with.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:39.000
I'll put it in he chat after you've had time in the breakout rooms

01:05:39.000 --> 01:06:09.000
And I'll have to put that call tricks page in the chat because for some reason I didn't put it on the website I can put it on the website. Also, but I'll put it in the chat.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I'd like you to use the breakout room that corresponds to your team number

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:59.000
After you've had some time in the breakout rooms. So I'm going to create nine breakout rooms, and I'd like you to use the breakout room that corresponds to your team number.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:22.000
So I sent out an email with your team number.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Let me do the breakout rooms now

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.000
The teams are numbered 1-9

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:16.000
And the breakout rooms will be 1-9

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:39.000
And let me do the breakout rooms now. And so the teams are numbered one through nine and the breakout rooms are going to be numbered one through nine.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Go to the one that corresponds to your team number

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Ask me if you don't know your team number

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:25.000
I will tell you

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:52.000
So go to the, the one that corresponds to your team number. And if you don't know what your team number is just ask me, and I will,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Oh, the qualtrics is on the page with the agenda

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000
I will tell you

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:55.000
the call tricks is on the page with the agenda.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Oh good.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Okay, so I'm sorry I did put that on I just forgot where I put it. So if you go to the agenda page.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:16.000
You'll put in your team number, and which which not for profit you would like to work with.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:26.000
And you're not necessarily so there are nine teams. There are two non profits. I'm going to put a sign for have you to one and five of you to the other.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:44.000
So you're not necessarily going to get your first choice, but please do put in your first choice.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Okay and then I see a lot of people haven't

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:55.000
haven't gone into breakout rooms, but I'm not saying, oh ok so somebody did ask.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Ok, ok so the interpreter should go to breakout room for a four okay.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000
I'm sorry no Breakout Room five breakout.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Okay.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:44.000
representatives are free to go now there's no, there's no more q&a anticipated. I'll just announced the assignments, and I'll be letting you know who is likely to want to contact you.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I really appreciate Jeff giving your email address out. I'm going to make sure that the teams that are working on yours will be able to contact you. Great.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Oh thanks very much this is, this is gonna be a lot of fun, really appreciate.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Thank you. And thank you, Debra.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Thank you very much.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Okay, so I still see a few people, not in breakout rooms.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:30.000
I prefer some like I didn't see the break out rooms, I'm in Team Six, I think.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Okay, so you should be able to see the breakout rooms at the bottom of the screen are at the bottom of the window.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:48.000
There should be an option for breakout rooms, it might be under more

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:59.000
COEC it under more. Oh yeah, I see that, thank you so much.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Okay, great.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:09.000
And then all of,

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:21.000
like, I'm sorry, how to get in there, I just see the, there's a Join button there should be a Join button a little blue button with white lettering.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Maybe I can actually oh I can put you in ok and then Holly.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Hi professor. I'm actually really read boys. The other capitalist.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Okay, so let me put aside all assign you to room for that's the room you should be in.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Okay.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I should have done that with the others.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Thank you.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Okay, so you should be able to join room for now.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Okay, I see Diana and creep are still are back here, clipper, I'm not sure how you pronounce your name. Yeah, that's great. Thank you.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Cooper, I'm not sure how you pronounce your name. Yeah, that's great. Thank you. Um, so yes we decided on which project to go on. And so, I think we're going to catch up over the Discovery Channel.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:42.000
So, is there any wrap up announcement to go yes there is because you're not necessarily going to get to do the one that you chosen. So I'm going to assign you to group so I'm going to try to balance it.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
So, if too many people chose one group rather than the other.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:51.000
I'll have to reassign you so please do stick around.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Yep, sure. Thank you.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:23.000
And we'll do that in just a few minutes.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Okay, so I'd like to find out if you have responded so I have five responses.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Two of them are from Team Six.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:24.000
One is from Team one and one is from Team five and one is from Team nine.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:37.000
By the way, do I need to re enable co host or interpreters still enabled.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
We're still close.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Okay. I don't know how breakout rooms, actually, you know if when you go into the breakout room it goes away some things are weird about the breakout rooms.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Okay, it seems that the majority so it looks like I've got now team three Team 19 five Team 16 one.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.000
So I'm just missing team seven.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:42.000
And, and team, eight, I think, is that right

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:49.000
him seven and teammate are still in their breakout rooms

01:23:49.000 --> 01:24:19.000
or team to I'm also missing team two are still in their breakout room.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Professor This is a capitalist.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:35.000
You have to disable the automatic captioning.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:42.000
And then, I'm pretty proceed to enable me as the captioning.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Oh,

01:24:45.000 --> 01:25:00.000
I thought I did. Oh you know what i enabled the first caption just yeah but right now it looks like you have the automatic speech recognition captioning on.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Yeah, I enabled the wrong person, or I enabled the person who was here before.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:16.000
So somehow you have to turn the live transcription off.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:26.000
And then yes, you just assigned me so I haven't No, thank you.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Alright so are you back on or is.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:34.000
I'm still seeing what looked to me like the automatic captions.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Hold on a second I can see if it's coming across I'm. Yeah, it looks like it's coming across that in mind also somehow you have to disable that or else the two will get confused and it won't work.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.000
 

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.000
TypeWell transcript started.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:20.000
TEST

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:48.000
TEST

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:54.000
So I'm still looking for Team 4. 

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Isabella: we are here. 

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Professor:   In terms of a Qualtrics entry. 

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Isabella:  Oh we didn't receive th link - 

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000
where is it again? 

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Professor:   On the agenda page. 

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Isabella:  Okay,

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:30.000
 we'll do that now. 

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Professor:   Teams 7 and 8 I still 

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:37.000
don't have. 

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:45.000
I'm going to close the rooms 

01:27:45.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Is anyone here from Teams 7 and 8? 

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I will assign a couple of teams to 

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Rochester Greenovation.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:51.000
  I think the easiest thing to do is 

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
assign the teams who haven't expressed 

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.000
an interest,

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:01.000
 that's Teams 7 and 8. 

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.000
And Team 4. 

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:16.000
So all 

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:23.000
those 3 teams that haven't expressed an 

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.000
interest I will assign to Rochester Greenovation

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:34.000
. 

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Mesha:  We couldn't find the link for 

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:44.000
the form. 

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Professor:   So I am assigning you to 

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.000
the other one though.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:59.000
  I will put that in the e-mail to you again. 

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Did you get that I am assigning Teams 4,

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:09.000
 7,

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:13.000
 8 and 9 to Greenovation and the other 

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000
five for RCN.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000
  Okay?

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Is everyone cool with that? 

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Yes,

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:36.000
 Greenovation was put down for Team 9. 

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:41.000
All I see now are there are some teams 

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:47.000
saying they couldn't find the link. 

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000
So that wraps up the meeting as far as 

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:59.000
I am concerned.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
  I will send you all an e-mail 

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:07.000
confirming things again. 

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:11.000
I will share my screen because there's 

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:18.000
one thing I want to make sure you see,

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.000
 and that is this checklist the UX club 

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:27.000
officers put together.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:33.000
  This is a suggestion about how to do it. 

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:38.000
This isn't the only way to do it,

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
 but this is something you can fall 

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:44.000
back on. 

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000
And there's a discord also.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:53.000
  I have 

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
already seen stuff on here too.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:59.000
  So definitely check this out. 

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:05.000
I 

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000
will e-mail these groups when I get 

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:11.000
more information. 

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Some interesting questions came up. 

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:31.000
For instance about the style guides.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
  I don't think Greenovation has a 

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
style guide.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:44.000
  This keeps disappearing. 

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:54.000
So it's back now. 

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I will keep in touch with you through 

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:04.000
some emails.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.000
  And you can keep in tough through 

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:15.000
discord or whatever channels you choose.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:24.000
  These slides are at mickmcquaid

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:31.000

/uxstudio.com

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Teams 4,

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000
 7,

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:06.000
 8 and 9 are assigned to 

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Rochester Greenovation,

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000
 and the other teams are assigned to RCN.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:23.000
  I will say that in an e-mail again. 

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Does anyone have any last minute 

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:34.000
questions?

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.000
  I will edit this recording when it 

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:43.000
becomes available,

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:54.000
 and then I will put it on again 

01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:24.000
.  Probably tomorrow morning. 

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Nihal is assigned to Team 4.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Isabella:  We will resend the Discord 

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:50.000
link to them.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Professor:   Alright,

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.000
 I am going to close out the Zoom call 

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:06.000
now unless you have questions or comments.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.000
  I look forward to chatting with you 

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
during the week and seeing you next 

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:18.000
week at the same time.
