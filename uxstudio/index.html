            <p class="black"><b>What will the week look like?</b>
            - Good question! UX Club officers have put together
            <a href="uxstudiohandout.pdf">a checklist</a> you can use to pace yourself.</p>
            <p class="black"><b>Do I need a team to
              register?</b> - No, teams will be assigned later
            on. You'll be assigned to a team of students
            in different years of their program, e.g.,
            one freshman, one sophomore, one junior, and
            one senior on a team.</p>
            <p class="black"><b>What non-profits will be
              participating?</b> - <i>Rochester
              Childfirst Network</i> and 
            <i>Rochester Greenovation</i>
            have agreed to
            participate.
            So there are
            two groups from which you may choose to do
            your design.</p>
            <p class="black"><b>Can any major
              participate?</b>
            - Yes! The competition is open to all RIT
            students!</p>
            <p class="black"><b>Will there be
              prizes?</b> - Each member of the two winning
            teams (one per non-profit) will receive a
            trophy!</p>
            <p class="black"><b>Who is judging the
              competition?</b> - The judging panel includes
            the the Dean of GCCIS, the Director of the
            iSchool, a faculty member from New Media
            Design, a faculty member from the iSchool,
            and one representative from each of
            the non-profits.</p>
            <p class="black"><b>What kind of guidance
              will we receive?</b> - There will be
            presentations from both
            non-profits at the kickoff meeting. You can
            see the presentation slides in advance
            here:</p>
