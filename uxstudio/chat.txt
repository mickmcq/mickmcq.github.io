00:38:54	Alex Kalomiris:	roommate's talking so, i'll type my follow-up to that here, if that's okay
00:40:07	Alex Kalomiris:	so, at those crunch times, would that doctor's office two-way communication style be preferable to, say, parents being able to schedule staggered pickup/drop-off times (as the example solution that came to mind)
