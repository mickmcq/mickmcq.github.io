# Report out from last week's exercise
- What did you do?
- What were the outcomes?
- What best practices can you report?

# Microinteractions
Definition from NNgroup: Microinteractions are trigger-feedback pairs in which (1) the trigger can be a user action or an alteration in the system's state; (2) the feedback is a narrowly targeted response to the trigger and is communicated through small, highly contextual (usually visual) changes in the user interface.

## Microinteraction flow

## Some are, some aren't

<small>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
*Digital element*   *Is it a microinteraction?*
-----------------   -----------------------------------------------
Scrollbar           Yes: User triggered; visual feedback to
                    user changing location within a page

Digital alarm       Yes: System triggered; auditory (and visual)
                    feedback to time condition being met

Button              It depends: If there is no feedback when a user
                    clicks the button, there is no microinteraction

Pull-to-refresh
animation           Yes: User triggered; visual feedback to a user
                      action

GIFs                No: Not triggered by the system or a user

Video player        No: It's a feature, not a microinteraction;
                    volume control would be a microinteraction

## Why?
Microinteractions can improve a product’s user experience by:

- Encouraging engagement
- Displaying system status
- Providing error prevention
- Communicating brand

# Pair designing
... getting more and better UX design done by putting two designers together as thought partners to solve design problems

:::

## Related practice: feedback relationship
part time, checking in with each other on work that’s been accomplished separately

## Pair designing differs from feedback relationship
being in the same room, working on the same problem, with both brains focused on the problem simultaneously for the duration of the project

## Roles
- One designer is the generator (or gen)
- One designer is the synthesizer (or synth)

## Gen
- Conveys an idea clearly and quickly
- Usually at the whiteboard or tablet
- Comfortable drawing in front of their partner
- Leaves ego out of it
- Has sophisticated understanding of contemporary design

## Synth
- Tests ideas as they are generated
- Keeps bigger picture in mind
- Writes design choices and rationales after debate
- Is detail-oriented and has strong memory
- Has sophisticated understanding of first principles and psychology

## Role swaps
- Gen gives the "pen" to the synth
- Usually gen has run out of ideas or swap is timed

## Why divide the work?
- Confirmation bias is part of gen's role
- Easier for another person (synth) to overcome
  confirmation bias on a given idea

## Why not remote collaboration?
- Distractions
- Network problems
- Lack of body language

## Stages
- Research (one member transcribes)
- Sensemaking (synth builds big picture, takes the lead)
- Wireframing / sketching (gen takes the lead in drawing)
- Detailed design (synth produces narrative, gen produces visuals)

## Exercise: pair design your microinteraction
- Break into pairs
- Choose some aspect of your project
- Spend the rest of class in gen and synth roles,
  swapping at least once
