# Microinteractions
Definition from NNgroup: Microinteractions are trigger-feedback pairs in which (1) the trigger can be a user action or an alteration in the system's state; (2) the feedback is a narrowly targeted response to the trigger and is communicated through small, highly contextual (usually visual) changes in the user interface.

## Microinteraction flow

## Some are, some aren't

<small>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
*Digital element*   *Is it a microinteraction?*
-----------------   -----------------------------------------------
Scrollbar           Yes: User triggered; visual feedback to
                    user changing location within a page

Digital alarm       Yes: System triggered; auditory (and visual)
                    feedback to time condition being met

Button              It depends: If there is no feedback when a user
                    clicks the button, there is no microinteraction

Pull-to-refresh
animation           Yes: User triggered; visual feedback to a user
                      action

GIFs                No: Not triggered by the system or a user

Video player        No: It's a feature, not a microinteraction;
                    volume control would be a microinteraction

## Why?
Microinteractions can improve a product’s user experience by:

- Encouraging engagement
- Displaying system status
- Providing error prevention
- Communicating brand

## Exercise
Design and share a microinteraction for your individual
course project.

# Pair designing
... getting more and better UX design done by putting two designers together as thought partners to solve design problems

## Related practice: feedback relationship
part time, checking in with each other on work that’s been accomplished separately

## Pair designing differs from feedback relationship
being in the same room, working on the same problem, with both brains focused on the problem simultaneously for the duration of the project

## Roles
- One designer is the generator (or gen)
- One designer is the synthesizer (or synth)

## Gen
- Conveys an idea clearly and quickly
- Usually at the whiteboard or tablet
- Comfortable drawing in front of their partner
- Leaves ego out of it
- Has sophisticated understanding of contemporary design

## Synth
- Tests ideas as they are generated
- Keeps bigger picture in mind
- Writes design choices and rationales after debate
- Is detail-oriented and has strong memory
- Has sophisticated understanding of first principles and psychology

## Role swaps
- Gen gives the "pen" to the synth
- Usually gen has run out of ideas or swap is timed

## Why divide the work?
- Confirmation bias is part of gen's role
- Easier for another person (synth) to overcome
  confirmation bias on a given idea

## Why not remote collaboration?
- Distractions
- Network problems
- Lack of body language

## Stages
- Research (synth transcribes) (what to do)
- Sensemaking (synth builds big picture, takes the lead) (how to do it)
- Wireframing / sketching (gen takes the lead in drawing)
- Detailed design (synth produces narrative, gen produces visuals)

::: {.notes}
For the upcoming exercise, you're going to spend the first stage deciding what to do. So think of research as talking about your project and what would make a good candidate for microinteraction.

Spend the second stage deciding how to do it. You've found a candidate for microinteraction, so now you have to make decisions about it concerning design elements like color and transition timing.

Spend the third stage and the fourth stage actually doing it. Initially sketch it, then accomplish it in Figma or whatever app.
:::

## Exercise: pair design your microinteraction
- Break into pairs (not your project teammate)
- Choose some aspect of either project during the research stage
- Spend the allocated time in gen and synth roles,
  swapping at each stage for four stages

## Did this work? If so, why?
- Pairing forces constant iteration: idea testing and course correction
- It brings to bear two brains and two stances
- Designers are happier
- Each partner can focus on their core aptitudes
- Who felt more natural as a gen? As a synth?

## Other reasons
- Partners learn from each other
- Materialize ideas early
- Vocalize rationale
- Constant course correction

# Bad UX
It's everywhere! Time now for you to share your examples!

(I can start with an example of an LMS)
