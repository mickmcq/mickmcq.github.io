% Tips I'm seeing so far

Go to Figma Community for password components

Go to a site or app you use and try to change your password and then grab the components

Do it in pencil on Procreate!

Use an animated bar to indicate password strength!

Each group member can work on a different asset / or a different prototype altogether

When you use red and green, add X and âœ“ to make it clear to colorblind users

You can use the Text Animations icon in the Figma toolbar to simulate typewriter effect for entering a password.
