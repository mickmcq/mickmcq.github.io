## Takeaways
::: {.incremental}
- People use different terms
- People use the term *design system* in different ways, all the wayfrom style guide to component libraries to basis for entire company (e.g., AirBnB)
- GitHub posits rules, constraints, and principles
  - example: color
  - rule: pass color contrast ratio of 4:5:1
  - constraint: number of colors in palette
  - principle: color used in a meaningful way
:::

## Takeaways, continued
::: {.incremental}
- GitHub started with color, typography, spacing, components, layouts
- GitHub added interaction models, voice and tone, words, grammar and mechanics
- GitHub uses [https://primer.style/](https://primer.style/)
- GitHub uses BEM-style notation [https://en.bem.info/](https://en.bem.info/)
- Material Design is aspirational for GitHub
:::

## Other examples
- [IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/)
- [IBM Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/)
- [Atlassian Design System](https://atlassian.design/)
- [Firefox](https://design.firefox.com/photon/) (obsolete but not yet replaced)
- [Salesforce](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/) (the original use of the term)

# But first ... Animation

## Animation Storyboards
- Val Head video [https://youtu.be/Itsg48crOjM](https://youtu.be/Itsg48crOjM)
- [Val Head interview](https://valhead.com/2016/12/08/sketching-interface-animations-an-interview-with-eva-lotta-lamm/)
- Trigger
- Action
- Quality

## Animation Storyboards

## Animation Storyboard Quality Symbols

## Animation Storyboard Example

## Animation Motion Comps
- aka Animatics
- Video of how animation works
- Very high fidelity

## Problem: Animate this!
![](fiOpenClose.png)

::: {.notes}
You could hand this to the developer and say "Animate this transition!" Instead, Val Head illustrates a motion comp of the transition in her video at [https://youtu.be/Itsg48crOjM](https://youtu.be/Itsg48crOjM).
:::

## Animation: Interactive Prototypes
- Allows the user to experience the trigger and the effect
- Gives the *feel* of the timing, not just the *look*
- Establishes context (e.g., bouncy, playful bank app)
- Intuit example [https://designsystem.quickbooks.com](https://designsystem.quickbooks.com) (go to Foundations > Motion)

# Ideation

## Day one of this course
::: {.incremental}
- We used a storyboard sheet to ideate
- But we could consider the interview and brainstorming the list of needs as part of the ideate process---they certainly lead up to it
- In fact, we can do anything that will help us come up with ideas!
- [IDEO](https://www.designkit.org/methods) suggests a three step process: inspiration, ideation, implementation
- Under Ideate, they suggest many activities, including journey mapping, HMW, and rapid prototyping; we'll examine HMW

## IDEO steps
- Brainstorm [https://www.designkit.org/methods/1](https://www.designkit.org/methods/1)
- Interview [https://www.designkit.org/methods/2](https://www.designkit.org/methods/2)
- How Might We [https://www.designkit.org/methods/3](https://www.designkit.org/methods/3)

## The How Might We step
- Rephrase insight statements from previous step as questions by adding "How might we" at the beginning
- Look for design opportunities from these questions
- Make each question broad enough to allow a number of solutions, but narrow enough to be actionable

# Diverging and Converging

*The best way to have an idea is to have lots of ideas.*

::: {style="text-align: right"}
--- Linus Pauling
:::

## Why diverge then converge
- You will not come up with a creative solution if you don't diverge
- You will not meet the deadline if you don't converge
- You must set a time limit for both processes

## How to diverge and converge
1. Ideate!
2. Implement ideas!

# Prototyping Levels

## lofi from @Buxton2007
![](fiConversation.png)

::: {.notes}
The “conversation” between the sketch (right bubble) and the mind (left
bubble). A sketch is created from current knowledge (top arrow). Reading,
or interpreting the resulting representation (bottom arrow), creates new
knowledge. The creation results from what @Goldschmidt1991 calls “seeing
that” reasoning, and the extraction of new knowledge results from what
she calls “seeing as.”

*My drawings have been described as pre-intentionalist, meaning that they were finished before the
ideas for them had occurred to me. I shall not argue the point.*

# System diagramming

## @Becker2020 view
![](fiSystemDiagramming.png)

## Issues with system diagramming
- By the way, it's usually called flowcharting
- Goes in and out of fashion
- Main issue is that there is no standard symbol set
- Therefore any flowchart can mean anything
- Many developers are schooled in UML, may resist anything else
- UML has roughly nine very specific diagram types, standardized worldwide

# Story about learning
- The time, the place, the people, and the skills
- aka The time, the place, and the people
- concerns Daud Sahil (sahil means guide or leader in Hindi)
