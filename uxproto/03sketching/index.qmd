Recap
:::

::: {.notes}
- sketches: mostly terrific, raises issue of how to sharpen your skills
- sketches: some appeared to use iPad---is that the best approach?
- sketches: different styles for graphical self-intro vs good design
- accessibility reports: well done (only one so far), used a lot of good techniques to convey information
- three things: act fast, think slow, energize yourself

# project ideas

## idea rejected, then reconsidered
::: {.incremental}
- presented idea was to help women seeking abortions in Texas
- rejected because it seemed like more of a privacy and security issue than a UX issue
- reconsidered because I then researched it and found UX issues
- e.g., websites to help undocumented migrants assume literacy and often English literacy
- two synergistic groups: drivers and patients

## Karim directives (excerpt)
<small>

::: {.container}
:::: {.col}
- Don't specialize
- Before giving birth to anything physical, ask yourself if you have created an original idea, an original concept, if there is any real value in what you disseminate.
- Know everything about the history of your profession and then forget it all when you design something new.
- Never say “I could have done that” because you didn’t.
- Consume experiences, not things.
::::
:::: {.col}
- Normal is not good.
- There are three types of beings—those who create culture, those who buy culture, and those who don’t give a shit about culture. Move between the first two.
- Think extensively, not intensively.
- Experience is the most important part of living, and the ex- change of ideas and human contact is all life really is. Space and objects can encourage increased experiences or distract from our experiences.
- Here and now is all we got

##
![](fiPalacioDeBellasArtes.png)

::: {.notes}
I visited the Palacio de Bella Artes in Mexico City in 2012. It's not a design museum specifically, but it did give me a lot of design inspiration nonetheless.
:::

##
![](fiBorgesEnMexico.png)

::: {.notes}
At the time, they were featuring an exhibition on Edvard Münch, as well as this exhibition about a trip by Borges to Mexico.
:::

##
![](fiMuralByDiegoRivera.png)

::: {.notes}
The museum features a lot of work by Diego Rivera, including this admittedly overexposed mural.
:::

##
![](fiDiegoRiveraMural.png)

::: {.notes}
This mural by Diego Rivera was in the same room as the previous one.
:::

##
![](fiMuralInMexicoCity.png)

::: {.notes}
And this mural was in the street, at a construction site.
:::

##
![](fiFridaDiego.png)

::: {.notes}
On the same trip, I visited some of the homes of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera which have been converted into museums. I think this is the only one where I got pictures.
:::

##
![](fiFridaDiegoHouse.png)

::: {.notes}
This is the view you see when you first enter the gate.
:::

##
![](fiFridasDesk.png)

This is Frida Kahlo's desk. I love to see the working environments of artists and I took a number of photographs of her workspace, a few of which follow.
:::

##

A closeup of one of her sketchbooks ...

:::

##
![](fiKidzania.png)

::: {.notes}
This is a view of Kidzania, a working city for children with branches in Mexico City, Dallas, and, I think, a few other places. Here the children are getting dressed in preparation to work as painters.

# Sketching
::: {.incremental}
- Easy enough to say just do it
- Nothing works like conscientious practice
- Once inspired, what keeps you going?
- Try @Dodson2006
- Try the five minute plan
:::

# Crazy eights
![](fiCrazyEights.png)

## How to do it
- Choose a site or app to work on
- Make a list of screens needed
- Fold a large sheet into 8 squares
- Quickly draw a screen on each square (one minute per screen)
- Can be one screen eight times or eight diff screens or a combo

## Develop your own shorthand
For example

- a boxed x means a photo
- a circle means an icon
- a straight line means a headline
- a squiggly line means body copy

## Pause for video

::: {.r-fit-text}
〈do your own crazy eights〉
:::

::: {.notes}

Use this bash code to give one minute to each panel; change 60 to 120 to give two minutes per panel

```
for i in $(seq 0 8); do printf "\a\n$i"; sleep 60; done
```
