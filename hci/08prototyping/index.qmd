# Q and A from last time

## Learning

##
There were so many experiences shared that addressed about the accessibility for the disability community. Recognizing and acknowledging the diverse feelings and challenges faced by individuals with disabilities is an essential first step towards creating inclusive solutions. There are possibilities that one solution works for a group doesn't work for the other: think for avenue for the product can help. One can include more than one avenue can help(subtitles, images can have more texts, etc). So, "Diversity in solutions is key".

##
Erica's talk was very inspiring.

##
I wasn't aware that screen sharing tools override screen readers functions making it inaccessible to blind and low-vision users. Other interesting issues I learned about were security and information sharing using screen readers.

##
I really enjoyed Ananya's presentation on Context-Awareness Settings. I think it was a very engaging presentation and topic that was very easy to understand, given the capabilities of devices these days. I think it was also from a good article.

## Q and A

##
Nothing unresolved. The class discussions were quiet broad and descriptive.

##
How can the process of co-ideation be made accessible using automated tools?

# Naheel Jawaid recap

## Naheel Jawaid
- Currently a UX designer at Google
- Plans to start own company soon
- Gave an engaging talk at UX Design club yesterday
- Offers free design school!

## Four things you do
- Product thinking
- Interaction design
- Visual design
- Communication

Example: AirBnB vs CraigsList

## Your portfolio
... must prove you can do these four things

## More from Naheel
- Schools set standards too low
- Show your work to industry people
- Pick one thing and go deep---keeping all doors open means you'll be last in line at each door
- If you're not getting offers, concentrate on doing good work---offers will emerge
- ARglasses example---constraints and landscape

## Recommendations
- tools: Protopie and Origami
- portfolios: thereal.kim and rauno.me/craft

# Discussion

## Prototyping
I teach a course on this topic and a couple of you are in that course! What do you think are the most important things to say about prototyping after seven weeks of it?

## Where do prototypes fit?

```{r}
#| engine = 'tikz',
#| echo=FALSE,
#| fig.alt='a wheel featuring the words design, prototype, and evaluate, separated by triangular arrows',
#| out.width='25%'
\usetikzlibrary{arrows,decorations.text,decorations.markings}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \filldraw[fill=green!20!white, draw=white] (0,0) circle (1.41cm);
  \filldraw[fill=white, draw=white] (0,0) circle (0.97cm);
  \path
    [decorate,decoration={
      text along path,
      text={|\sffamily|\ DESIGN PROTOTYPE EVALUATE \ },
      text color={green!50!black},
      text align={fit to path stretching spaces},
      reverse path}
    ]
    (0,0) circle (1.1cm);
  \path
    [decorate,decoration={
      markings,
      mark=at position 0.6cm with {\arrow[green!50!black,line width=0.40mm]{triangle 90 reversed}},
      mark=at position 3.1cm with {\arrow[green!50!black,line width=0.40mm]{triangle 90 reversed}},
      mark=at position 6.0cm with {\arrow[green!50!black,line width=0.40mm]{triangle 90 reversed}}
      }
    ]
    (0,0) circle (1.19cm);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

::: {.notes}
This is a picture of design from the designer's point of view. It doesn't mention the developers or clients. It's a picture of design activities apart from communicating with stakeholders, because communicating with stakeholders may happen at any moment in the process.

Design could also be called *generate alternatives*. Prototyping could also be called *implement one alternative*. So you could say evaluate means to *evalauate one alternative*.

## How many kinds of prototypes are there?
I claim there are only two: prototypes for contention and prototypes for refinement. Of course, that raises the question of where Wizard of Oz prototypes fit into that dichotomy.

How many kinds of prototypes do you believe there are?

## What is the purpose of different levels of fidelity?

## Do different companies have different prototyping processes?
A VP of Oracle Medical Systems told me that his customers don't want to see lofi prototypes at all. They want their branding in everything they see.

A guest speaker from ExxonMobil told my other class that he wants to see paper and pencil sketches or whiteboard sketches.

## Wizard of Oz
I disagree with the book that this method is rare. I saw a demo of it yesterday for a study of new VR technology that is not yet implemented. The designers are trying to decide which technology to implement, so they're doing a Wizard of Oz study of five possibilities.

## Misinformation in affordances
A previous student (Christina Jia) pointed out that this can occur anywhere, not just doors. Can we think of some examples?

## Is affordance only relevant as an influence?
Well, is it?

## Do designers bear responsibility for privacy?
What if privacy conflicts with engagement?

## How much information should affordances share?
Can there be too much? Too little?

## Do people make prototypes that require different skills?
What about physical prototypes? (I've seen plenty for a wide assortment of reasons---can you imagine some of the kinds and some of the reasons?)

## What terminology is common in industry?
What industry do you mean? Tech may be homogeneous because of groupthink, but others may be less so.

::: {.notes}
The “conversation” between the sketch (right bubble) and the mind (left
bubble). A sketch is created from current knowledge (top arrow). Reading,
or interpreting the resulting representation (bottom arrow), creates new
knowledge. The creation results from what @Goldschmidt1991 calls “seeing
that” reasoning, and the extraction of new knowledge results from what
she calls “seeing as.”
