# Specs

## Read the fine manual!
- Only one group convinced me that they read all the specs!
- There's not supposed to be *padding* in the specs
- That means you should parse them carefully

## Think about stakeholders
- Customers, sure
- Competitors
- Clients who manage customers
- Suppliers

# Conversation

## You didn't say enough in HW1
- You probably have ideas, but what are they?
- Most of your explanations are vague

## Conversation with me based on feedback
- Don't tell me you're ready to go without following up
- Use office hours or brief emails

## Conversation with others
- Talk to each other: Discord, FtoF
- Talk to your family and friends
- You'll be surprised by the volume of feedback you can get
- You don't need much output to start a conversation

# Covenants

## You don't have any!
- Or they're not very specific
- You need them so you don't need them
- You probably won't enforce them
- They need to be measurable

# Scope

## Too narrow
- You want to slightly modify something bad
- You have a todo list of fixes
- You're playing it too safe
- There's no journey here

## Too wide
- The next Spotify
- Something a large team took years to do
- Something that needs partners

# Direction

## Too technical
- It depends too much on what the coders can do
- You can *easily* make something that would work, if only ...

## Too marketing
- It depends too much on good marketing
- You're challenging Spotify or some similarly large entity

# Dilemmas

## Extra work
- Should I give you credit for making personas?
- Should I downgrade you for not doing them as well as perhaps you could?
- Better not to include extras but instead try to get the milestone right

## Website
- You don't get extra credit for a nice website
- To me, it's just an information container
- But to a recruiter, it may mean more
- You may want to make it easy to navigate in any case

## Discovering problems
- Should I praise you for discovering problems?
- Should I downgrade you for depicting your targets as idiots?
- Be nice

# Goals for HW2

## Start a conversation
- Make your prototype so it inspires people to talk about it
- Worst thing would be to make it slick
- Worst question they could ask would be "wow, how did you do that?"

## Recognize constraints
- Design is all about constraints
- You have to understand then to work with them
- If you're lucky, you'll find synergy

## Make choices
- Don't be tempted to turn in everything you did
- In your choice lies your talent
- Don't be afraid to throw away yesterday's rehearsal
- The best work happens after you throw some things away
