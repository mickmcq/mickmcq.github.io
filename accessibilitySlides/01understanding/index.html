<h1>Let’s explore four things</h1>
<ul>
<li>physical and sensory disabilities</li>
<li>cognitive disabilities</li>
<li>disability concepts</li>
<li>disability experiences</li>
</ul>
<p>But first, why do we care about these four things?</p>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>physical and sensory disabilities, including blind and low vision,
deaf and hard of hearing, motor impairments, speech impairments, and
other physical disabilities</li>
<li>cognitive disabilities, including memory, problem solving,
attention, thinking, reading, linguistic and verbal comprehension, math
comprehension, visual comprehension, and digital affinity</li>
<li>disability concepts, including temporary, permanent, and situational
limitations, and the spectrum of ability</li>
<li>disability experiences, including the need to watch videos and hold
meetings with self-advocates and family members, videos or meetings with
representatives of advocacy organizations, and videos or meetings with
engineers and scientists who have worked on accessibility</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do we care about these things? If we’re practicing user-centered
design, we need to understand something about our users. Of course, it’s
easier to understand your users if you understand yourself and
understand the way you look at things outside of yourself.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do we think of situations?</li>
<li>Do we think of medicine?</li>
<li>Do we think of social constructs?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<aside class="notes">
<p>How do we think of disability? Do we think of it as arising in
situations? For example, the tunnel illustrates a situation in which
some people can use this passageway, while others cannot.</p>
<p>Do we think of what is popularly called the <em>medical model</em> of
disability, where disability is something to be cured? In this case, we
wouldn’t dream of altering the tunnel, instead dreaming of “curing”
people who can’t use it.</p>
<p>Or do we think of disability as a social construct, a mismatch
between what society provides and what some people can use? This latter
interpretation of disability is encouraged by the community of
disability activists (or should I say advocates), whose work forms most
of the basis for this lecture.</p>

<p>If we’re a wheelchair user, this might be a very appealing sign. On
the other hand, I’ve seen non-wheelchair users express resentment over
these spaces. I’ve even seen a non-disabled person parking in one and a
crowd gather to prevent him from leaving until the police arrived to
give him a ticket.</p>

<p>This image shows an ATM keypad with braille on each key. This is a
commonly provided accommodation since the passing of the Americans with
Disabilities Act in 1990.</p>
<p>Physical and sensory disabilities include blind and low vision, deaf
and hard of hearing, motor impairments, speech impairments, and other
physical disabilities. Pictured is a Braille pinpad, allowing a blind
user who understands Braile to enter pin number in an ATM. Braille
literacy has declined in the US, by the way. In 1960, 50% of legally
blind, school-age children in the US could read Braille. In 2015, this
number may have been 8.6%, according to the annual report of the
American Printing House for the Blind. Wikipedia’s article on Braille
reports that the reasons are varied, including constrained school
budgets, technological advances, and different philosophical positions
on educating blind children.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Cognitive disabilities include memory, problem solving, attention,
thinking, reading, linguistic and verbal comprehension, math
comprehension, visual comprehension, and digital affinity. Digital
affinity is a new concept championed by Gregg Vanderheiden at the
University of Maryland. Briefly, it posits that some people lack talent
for working with digital artifacts and that these people are severely
disadvantaged in a world requiring digital interactions.</p>

<p>The Special Olympics was created in 1968 to provide sports and
community to people with intellectual and physical disabilities. It is a
separate organization from the Paralympics, which is held in tandem with
the Olympics.</p>

<p>Disability experiences</p>
<p><img src="fiNothingAboutUsWithoutUs.jpg" width="720" alt-text="A group of disabled people hold a banner saying NOTHING ABOUT US WITHOUT US"/></p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Disability experiences include the need to watch videos and hold
meetings with self-advocates and family members, videos or meetings with
representatives of advocacy organizations, and videos or meetings with
engineers and scientists who have worked on accessibility.</p>

<p>We need to educate disabled designers, so that your design team
includes them. The next best thing is for designers to communicate with
disabled people and people who have thought a lot about disability.
There’s a spectrum of communication ranging from reading to video to
direct experience, and a spectrum of people who have thought about
disability in different professions.</p>
<p>“Nothing About Us Without Us” is a commonly used phrase by disability
advocates. It was first popularized in the 1990s during the disability
rights movement. It was created to explain that part of disability
rights is including disabled people in legislature, media, and more, to
provide more representation for the disabled community.</p>
