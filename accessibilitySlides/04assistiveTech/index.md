# Pause to demo screen reader

::: notes

My class meets in a macOS lab, so screen readers are built into the machines. This may not be possible if you are on Windows. One alternative is, if the students have iPhones, to use VoiceOver there. Another alternative is to simulate a screen reader by having students pair up with one at the keyboard and one acting as the screen reader.
