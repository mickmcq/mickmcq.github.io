# Rochester Greenovation
is a not-for-profit volunteer-run agency on a mission to make sure nothing useful goes to the landfill. Their motto is *Shop, Donate, Reimagine*.

  ## Greenovation's facility
  at 850 St Paul St downtown is an 18,000 sq ft second-hand store. They also have an eBay store and a Poshmark store, but these are run by volunteers with limited time and show only a few items.

  ## Greenovation's online presence
  is fragmented. Different volunteers run Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and perhaps other social media outlets. Facebook is the first hit when I google *Rochester Greenovation*, while the website is seventh. Instagram and TikTok don't make the front page.

  They're first on the Yelp list that comes up first in googling *Rochester thrift store* but they don't appear on the first page of *Rochester secondhand*.

  ## A typical visit
  lasts from 30 minutes (needed to cover the space) to three hours!

  There are several kinds of visitors:

  - people just looking around
  - people who love thrifting
  - people trying to find something in particular, such as a desk or couch or table
  - slumlords, resellers, and flippers
  - people looking for deals

  ## Volunteers
  are always pressed for time. Most communicate through text and phone calls but a couple have no tech at all.

  Most have a set schedule but some pop in when they feel like it.

  Greenovation works with agencies that help mentally challenged adults find work&mdash;their clients volunteer at Greenovation to prep for paying jobs.

  If Greenovation has to close for any emergency, they make about 25 phone calls and texts to volunteers and agencies.

  ## Design Opportunities
  are many. An app may be more useful than a website, because most people physically in the store could easily access it.

  - Photos are a big deal for Greenovation. An app that encouraged people to post and review photos of merchandise and was usable by non-tech-savvy shoppers might work better than Instagram or TikTok.
  - Communication is a big deal for Greenovation. One place all volunteers and shoppers could trust for the latest updates or give their own updates might work better than Twitter.
  - Connection to Greenovation's many online incarnations may be helpful.
