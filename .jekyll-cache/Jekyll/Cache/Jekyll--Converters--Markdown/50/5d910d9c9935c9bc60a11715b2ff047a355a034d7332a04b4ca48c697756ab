<p>For the past nine years, my main camera has been a member of the Fujifilm X100 family, first the original X100, then the T, the F, and now the V, seen here through the default lens of an iPhone 11 Pro Max. You can see a sample of its video capabilities in a short clip of Coco at <a href="https://youtu.be/noSdcksQb8g">youtube</a>.</p>
