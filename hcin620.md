Designing meaningful relationships among people and the products they use is both an art and a science. This course will focus on the unique design practice of (1) representing and organizing information in such a way as to facilitate perception and understanding (information architecture) and (2) specifying the appropriate mechanisms for accessing and manipulating task information (interaction design). This course will also explore the various design patterns (design solutions to particular problems) that are appropriate for the HCI professional. Students will need prior knowledge of an interface prototyping tool.
