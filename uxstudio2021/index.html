            <p>UX Studio is a week-long design jam
            hosted by the iSchool in the Golisano
            College of Computing and Information
            Sciences. From January 25th-29th, 2021,
            teams of four will work together virtually
            to create designs for various non-profit organizations.</p>
            <p>We'll meet on Zoom at 5PM on January 25th
            to kick off the event and get the charges
            from the non-profits.</p>
            <p>We'll meet again on Zoom at 5PM on
            January 29th for presentations and
            judging.</p>

            <p class="black"><b>What will the week look like?</b>
            Good question! UX Club officers have put together
            <a href="uxstudiohandout.pdf">a checklist</a> you can use to pace yourself.</p>
            <p class="black"><b>Do I need a team to
              register?</b> - No, teams will be assigned later
            on. You'll be assigned to a team of students
            in different years of their program, e.g.,
            one freshman, one sophomore, one junior, and
            one senior on a team.</p>
            <p class="black"><b>What non-profits will be
              participating?</b> - <i>Catholic Family
              Center</i>, 
            <i>Water for South Sudan</i>, and
            <i>Rochester Museum and Science Center</i>
            have all agreed to
            participate.
            So there are
            three groups from which you may choose to do
            your design.</p>
            <p class="black"><b>Can any major
              participate?</b>
            - Yes! The competition is open to all RIT
            students!</p>
            <p class="black"><b>Will there be
              prizes?</b> - Each member of the three winning
            teams (one per non-profit) will receive a
            trophy!</p>
            <p class="black"><b>Who is judging the
              competition?</b> - The judging panel includes
            the Dean of the College, the Director of the
            iSchool, one iSchool professor, and one representative from each of
            the non-profits.</p>
            <p class="black"><b>What kind of guidance
              will we receive?</b> - There will be
            presentations from each of the three
            non-profits at the kickoff meeting. You can
            see the presentation slides in advance
            here:</p>
