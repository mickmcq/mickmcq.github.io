## Supported Testing
- Tasks
- Five-second test
- Verbal response
- Written response
- Multiple choice
- Rating scale

## Five second test
The five second test function will show the URL listed in the Starting URL field to your contributors for five seconds only. Afterward, we'll ask them three questions to recall their impressions and understanding of the page. (requires Google Chrome browser)

- What do you remember?
- What can you do on this site?
- Who's this site for?
