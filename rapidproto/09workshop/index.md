# But first, a PSA from UXPA
Gayathri will share an event happening tomorrow at noon in Room 210A

# But first, Group six

# Design Thinking revisited

## @Stackowiak2020
- Uses the Double Diamond approach to design thinking (We used the Stanford Design School's approach on the first day of class)
- DD was first published by the UK Design Council in 2004
- The double diamond shapes refer to diverging then converging, first on the problem, then on the solution

## Double Diamond approach

## Double Diamond Problem Space
- Discover
  - Setting scope
  - Determining people / stakeholders
  - Determining current state
- Define
  - Converge on problem
  - May substitute a new problem for the initial problem specified
  - Understand why solving the problem matters

## Double Diamond Solution Space
- Design / Develop
  - Ideate
  - Generate a lot of solutions
- Determine / Deliver
  - Prioritize candidate solutions on value and effort required
  - Test candidate solutions
  - Converge on one solution
- Phases are nonlinear

## DD Design Principles
- Put people first---start with an understanding of the people using a service: their needs, strengths, and aspirations
- Communicate visually and inclusively---help people gain a shared understanding of the problem and ideas
- Collaborate and co-create---work together and be inspired by co-workers
- Iterate---spot errors early, mitigate risk, and build confidence in ideas

# Leading a prototyping workshop

This is all based on @Stackowiak2020

## Steps
- Conveying what the workshop is all about
- Roles and responsibilities
- Coordination prior to the workshop
- Facilitation and independent research
- Top-of-mind industry topics
- Workshop facility and supplies
- Summary

# Conveying what the workshop is all about

## You need a concise statement

*A diverse group of business and technology stakeholders and potential users of software and AI solutions are brought together in a Design Thinking workshop to define and prioritize the challenges that they face and collaborate in an innovative fashion to determine possible solutions to those challenges. They share a common goal of driving significant business impact. A Design Thinking workshop typically takes place over a period of one or two days.*

## Conveying the benefits
- Creates alignment by gathering a diverse team that breaks down silos in an organization and unifies exploration of problems and solutions
- Provides a highly interactive experience that assures engagement of all interested parties present
- Leads to new insight by collaboratively looking at problems, solutions, and potential impacts at a deeper level from many diverse points of view

## Another benefit to convey
- For all engaged, creates a feeling of ownership of the problems and solutions that are identified in the workshop (each person develops a vested interest in addressing what is uncovered)

## Providing the agenda (1 of 2)
1. Introductions and logistics
2. An introduction to Design Thinking
3. Establishing diverse teams for the workshop
4. A discussion/determination of the most important goal(s) of the organization
5. Creating a unified vision around the goal(s)
6. Choosing scope(s) to address the goal(s)
7. Creating a stakeholder map and describing personas of select stakeholders

## Providing the agenda (2 of 2)
8. Denoting positives, negatives, and opportunities for identified scope(s) and stakeholders
9. Transitioning to ideation through a “how might we” statement
10. Using a creative matrix to identify possible solutions
11. Placing solutions on a value-effort chart
12. Creating a storyboard/visualization
13. Further solution evaluation
14. Road map of next steps

# Roles and responsibilities

## Overlap
![](fiRolesResponsibilities.png)

## Key Roles
- Facilitator: familiar with best practices of design thinking, skill as a coach, ability to maintain team focus, ability to assure clarity of ideas and outcomes
- Proctors: less experienced facilitators
- Scribes: collect analog content, taking notes, photos

# Coordination prior to the workshop

## Best practice
Best practice is pre-call between facilitator and sponsors or key participants to:

- Define workshop value and outcomes
- Set guidelines and rules for the workshop
- Confirm the right participants will be present
- Ask for additional information

## Define workshop value and outcomes
Get client to agree that it's important to disrupt work for one to two days


## Get client on board with activities
  - Identification of a “north star” vision of where to focus improvements in the business
  - Understanding problems inhibiting success
  - Defining how to measure success
  - Empathizing w/ stakeholders who help or hinder success
  - Aligning teams to co-create/innovate ideas that drive needed outcomes
  - Prioritizing the most impactful ideas into concepts that can be realized
  - Defining the business impact + visualizing the solution(s)

## Set client expectation for outcomes
- A clear agreed-upon vision of the future
- An understanding of the risk in maintaining the status quo
- Alignment regarding clearly defined success criteria
- Documented business and technical challenges
- Documented views of key stakeholders with impact
- Solution ideas to problems that are prioritized based on business impact and technical implementation efforts needed
- An action plan to move solution idea(s) forward with clear ownership, timelines, and next steps

## Set guidelines and rules for the workshop
- Bring an open mindset to the workshop.
- Be physically present during the workshop.
- Laptops will be turned off and other mobile devices put away (if these are not being used for note-taking) as no email or texting unrelated to the workshop should be exchanged when it takes place.
- Exercises will be timed to keep the workshop on track.
- Any discussions determined out of scope during the workshop will be noted and deferred to an appropriate time.

# Confirm the right participants will be present

## Examples of the right participants
- Sponsors
- Managers, CFO, CIO, analysts, data scientists, suppliers, distributors, software developers
- Facilitator
- Proctors
- Scribe(s)

# Pre-workshop research

## Ask for additional information
- Areas that the client wants to focus upon, possibly including the biggest challenges motivating executives
- Workshop outcomes desired by the executive sponsor
- A list of primary stakeholders impacted by the defined areas of focus including their ability to attend the workshop, their areas of interest, and their incentives
- Their “service blueprint” that provides a customer/support/ operational view of their organization (and its relationship to their areas of focus)

## Even more additional information
- Any history they have with previous Design Thinking workshops or similar workshops and possible barriers to success
- The state of data associated with their areas of focus including completeness and quality
- General business challenges
- Topics, technologies, and areas of the business to avoid during the workshop

## Facilitation and independent research
Find out about tailwinds and headwinds, such as

- Political factors such as organizational power structure, policies, stability of leadership and organization, existing agreements among different entities, and willingness to take risk and invest
- Economic factors such as market health, purchasing power of their clients, material costs, transportation and labor costs, amount of debt, rates of inflation and interest, and employment rates

## More tailwinds and headwinds
- Social factors such as changing demographics, diversity of workers and clients, societal values, available skills and levels of education, and attitudes toward technology and data privacy
- Technological factors such as the diversity of data, quality of data, proliferation of data sources, flexibility and integration capabilities of existing systems and equipment, availability of artificial intelligence and machine learning compute resources, and rates of innovation present in similar competing companies and organizations

## Even more tailwinds and headwinds
- Environmental factors such as energy utilization and availability, other raw material and natural resource considerations, impact on pollution and climate change, and ability to withstand extreme weather and other natural conditions and events
- Legal factors including local, national, and international laws and regulations, contracts, taxation, and liability implications

## Business model canvas key factors
- Value propositions that define what is being delivered as products or services to customers, clients, and/or constituents
- Customer/client/constituent segments that describe who products or services are being created for and which of the segments are targeted as being most important
- Customer/client/constituent relationships that describe current and desired relationships
- Channels that describe how the various segments are reached

## More business model canvas key factors
- Key activities that describe how value propositions are delivered to the segments
- Key resources that describe what is needed to deliver the value propositions
- Key partners that describe suppliers, distributors, and others outside of the company or organization needed to deliver the value propositions
- Cost structure describing the most significant cost items needed to deliver the value propositions and/or respond to threats or potential changes in the future

## One more business model canvas key factor
- Revenue streams describing revenue (or monetary value) produced by the delivered value propositions and pressures that could change the revenue figures

*Cautionary note: Research can cause bias and so you should not be married to all this pre-workshop research if it turns out that sponsors or other key participants disagree with your findings.*

# Workshop facility and supplies

## Facility
The workshop facilitator has to

- Make sure there are enough chairs!
- Make sure the room is the right shape for collaboration
- Decide whether to allow electronics and, if so, make sure there are outlets and adapters and, if not, make sure there are places to hang posters and large pads
- Make sure people can find the place!

## Supplies - if analog
- Sticky note easel pad(s) and easel(s) – One per team taking part.
- Multi-color small sticky notes – Supply each participant with multiple colors (colors usage is described in later chapters covering workshop exercises).
- Writing markers – Supply each participant with a marker such that when they write their ideas, the markings will be readable from a distance.
- Stickers such as stars and smiley faces – Used by each participant when voting occurs during the workshop.

## More analog supplies
- Index cards – Multiple cards are provided to each participant.
- Plain sheets of paper (8x10) – A few sheets are provided to each participant.
- Squeezable toys – Enough toys should be on the table such that each participant can have at least one (as these can help spur creative ideas).
- Name tents – To identify each participant.

## Still more analog supplies
- Timing clock(s) – Visible to each participant during timed exercises.
- Mobile camera – Usually a mobile phone, this is used to capture output from exercises.

*Cautionary note: The facilitator is responsible for a __LOT__ so delegation may be needed, but so is a communication channel to prevent bottlenecks and ensure nothing is overlooked.*

## Supplies - if digital
- Big screen(s) (may need separate screens for Zoom and shared artifacts such as whiteboards and clocks and backchannel)
- Miro or Figjam or Google Docs (or similar) account that everyone has access to
- Backchannel - a shared document or Slack or Discord channel where people can chat without interrupting any verbal flow
- Many of the analog supplies are still needed
