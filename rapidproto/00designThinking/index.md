How to Start
:::

---

::: {.r-fit-text}
Read the syllabus?
:::

(eventually we'll hafta)

---

::: {.r-fit-text}
Go around the room saying our names?
:::

(eventually we'll hafta)

---

::: {.r-fit-text}
Get the juices flowing!
:::

---

::: {.r-fit-text}
WHY?
:::

---

I think it's better to start with an exercise that reminds us of what we do, no matter how proficient we are at it.

I need to know something about you and this is a very revealing exercise.

What the heck does that mean? (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test)
:::

---

- Empathize
- Define
- Ideate
- Prototype
- Test

::: {.notes}
That's one view of the design thinking process. I'd like you to engage in that process today.

Now do what they did!
:::

---

::: {.r-fit-text}
Materials
:::

- three pages
- some index cards (about 6)
- some colored sharpies (at least 3)
- a pen or pencil

---

::: {.r-fit-text}
Form Groups
:::

- first form a pair with someone like you
- then form a group of four with a pair that identifies differently from you (gender, ethnicity, or other identity factors)
- this gives you support (pair) and diversity (group of four)

---

::: {.r-fit-text}
Protocol
:::

- Empathize (interview)
- Define (list of needs)
- Ideate (storyboard sheet)
- Prototype (cards)

---

::: {.r-fit-text}
‹interview›
:::

- break into pairs so everyone gets a chance to be interviewer and interviewee
- interview is about supporting new year's resolutions
- if you're a trio go 2-on-1 or 1-on-2 either way

---

::: {.r-fit-text}
‹make a list of needs›
:::

- analyze the interview
- be sure to think about what they meant, not just what they said
- think about how you could have gotten more from the interview

---

::: {.r-fit-text}
‹storyboard›
:::

- draw four panels of cartoons on the ideate page
- show a successful interaction with an app
- don't worry about the app details
- concentrate on the user experience &mdash; what did the user feel?

---

::: {.r-fit-text}
‹prototype›
:::

- now use the index cards
- draw a few main app screens
- focus on making it easy for the user
- think about the circumstances of use

---

## test
- we're skipping the test phase due to time constraints
- but keep your cards so you can test later
- it's never too early to test
- but testing is the focus of a different course

## our focus: prototype

::: {.r-fit-text}
what did we learn?
:::

- give me your insights about each phase and write them in your sketchbook
- phases were
  - empathize (interview)
  - define (list)
  - ideate (storyboard)
  - prototype (cards)

::: {.notes}

I casually mention on this slide that you should write something in your sketchbook! If you don't keep a sketchbook, consider these questions: Are you a designer? Do you aspire to be a designer? I refer you to @Pink2005, which is a book asking people to learn from designers. One of the recommendations in the book is to keep a sketchbook. In the sketchbook, you write and sketch but you don't paste in elements like printouts of digitally created art. Instead, you develop your eye-hand coordination by doing manual sketching and writing. At least two fifths of a typical designer's time is spent at the whiteboard, so this activity can support a lot of your work.

::: {.notes}
I've put a daunting amount of reading on Canvas. I typically expect grad students to pace themselves on reading, so I'm not going to say too much about it except that most of it can be read piecemeal. The exception is @Baker2017, which is a novel about UX in a world with zombies. I think she wrote it that way to keep your interest up, but the fact is that it is a single continuous story that you should probably read through in a linear manner. That's not the case for a lot of the other books that can, for example, be consulted when you're working on a particular kind of design challenge.

I should add that the librarian told me that I'm only allowed to put three chapters of any book on Canvas, so I did that with all the books. You can find some of them on the library website and you may want to buy some, although a few of them are absurdly expensive. I can not advocate that you go to libgen.rs and download the books for free, partially because it may be illegal to do so. The courts ruled at one time that you had to deprive someone of ownership for an act to be considered theft. That hasn't stopped the music and publishing industries from labeling downloading as theft, though, and they have enjoyed some handsome out of court settlements over file sharing. Another reason you may disapprove of libgen (as well as scihub) is that it is hosted in Russia, not the most popular country right now. Further, you may feel that the academic publishing industry is not a bunch of parasitic gangsters and instead feel that they fairly compensate authors for their work. You may not feel that universities should *cut out the middleman* and take over academic publishing. For all these reasons, I do not endorse libgen and only mention it for the sake of raising issues about publishing.

A few of the books are the topics of lectures, namely @Patton2014a, @Greever2020, @Buxton2007, @Becker2020, and @Stackowiak2020. You may want to prioritize these in your reading.

design principles
:::

---

I want you to familiarize yourselves with four sets of design principles to keep in mind during the design challenges and your final exam project:

1. Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for iOS, macOS, and watchOS
2. Material Design from Google
3. Fluent Design from Microsoft
4. Inclusive Design from Microsoft

Use any one or any combination of these guidelines in developing your prototypes. Let's look at their websites, which are always changing so I don't want to make slides out of them. Instead, google the above names.

‹skipping Framer for now›
:::

::: {.notes}
I'm high on Framer because of its excellent JavaScript output, which cuts down on cycle time. You will often hear me say that cutting down cycle time is a high priority in rapid prototyping. Framer easily beats Figma in this regard, but Framer only recently acquired a free tier, so Figma has captured most of the mindshare. I want to expose you to Framer as well, but the Framer tutorial we will follow isn't ready yet.

design challenge 1

## Njideka Akunyili Crosby

![](fiNjidekaAkunyiliCrosby.png){width=70% fig-alt="photo of the artist seated"}

::: {.notes}
This is a photo of an artist named Njideka Akunyili Crosby. Her first name is evidently pronounced nnn-jee-deh-car even though there is no R in it! The photo was given to me on a piece of paper by a curator at a museum, with no attribution on the page. It simply says that she is from Enugu, Nigeria, which is a large city of 722,000 in southeastern Nigeria. She was born in 1983 and currently works in Los Angeles, CA.
:::

## Protocol

1. Go to the Blanton Museum of Art on campus
2. Obtain a small stool from one of the curators
3. Find the room on the next slide
4. Stare at the largest painting in the room for at least ten minutes
5. Create a prototype of a digital artifact to satisfy some need of one of the two people in the painting
6. Submit the prototype by Monday morning

## The exhibit at Blanton

![](fiCrosbyExhibit.jpg){fig-alt="Photo of Blanton museum room with Crosby exhibit"}

## The painting itself

![](fiMotherChild.jpg){fig-alt="Photo of painting by Crosby, depicting a seated woman with a small child on her lap"}

## How can you approach this task?
1. First just look at the painting for ten minutes without learning anything about it.
2. Optionally learn about the painting and its background, using the plaque beside it and web or curatorial resources
3. Think about the environment of these two people, their needs, and values
4. Design a prototype that reflects what you know about them

## File submission
- How can you submit a prototype created in Framer, Figma, XD, etc., to Canvas?
- There are several ways possible
- My preference is that you create a narrated video of navigating the prototype
- You may lack the skill to do so
- Should we teach that skill as part of prototyping?
