::: {.notes}
You worked through the first four stages in our first class and turned them in. Here are a few comments about them.

First, some of you used the "Scan Documents" feature of Apple Notes or, if you were on Android, Camscanner. These are apps that use computational photography to deliver a better image than the built-in camera app. I really appreciated those entries and would doubly appreciate it if you could show your neighbors how to use those apps.

Second, some of you organized your uploads so that I would see them in the order you created them. That was really helpful and you may want to show your neighbors some of the techniques you used for that, such as numbering your files or incorporating them all into an ordered pdf.

Third, some of you wrote legible interview notes. That can be a real challenge since you're trying to listen and record at the same time, but it is good to get into the habit of doing so well. For example, you may want to ask your interviewee to repeat something or interject, "Let me make a note of that", to signal that you don't want them to speak for a short time. You may want to develop a shorthand technique. Actually, some of you used shorthand techniques that may not be familiar to readers, such as the greek letter delta as a shorthand for change.

Fourth, many of you did a really good job of analyzing your interview notes and establishing a coherent, manageable list of needs. Of course, the interviewees sometimes didn't nail down a specific resolution and that really showed up in your lists of needs, storyboards, and prototypes. There has to be a specific objective and, if your interviewee is too diffuse, you have to help them prioritize.

Fifth, some of you made good storyboards. This was the weakest section for most, though. I wonder if you have a good sense of what the storyboard is meant to convey. The most common problem was diving into app specifics rather than the user experience. What does the user get from using your app?

Sixth, most of you made good use of your index cards. A few did not use all six cards, which was unfortunate. Six is not many! Also, the flow from one card to the next was not always clear. One person did a terrific job of annotating the photograph of the cards with arrows to show the flow. I was probably happiest with the cards overall, happier than with any of the process artifacts. That tells me you know how to create polished apps, but you may be a bit awkward with the process of making them the *right* prototypes. So I hope we can explore some tools to help you make the *right* prototypes.

Finally, some of you addressed the comments I made in Canvas with comments of your own! This was great. I'm not sure I responded to all of them. I don't see a mechanism in Canvas for telling who has made new comments.

## Still You Bloom in This Land of No Gardens

![](fiMotherChild.jpg){fig-alt="Photo of painting by Crosby, depicting a seated woman with a small child on her lap"}

::: {.notes}
This painting is a self-portrait of Nigerian artist Njideka Akunyili Crosby with her 2 year old biracial son sitting on the back porch of their home in Los Angeles.

The design challenge was to make a digital artifact of use to either of the people depicted in the painting, taking into account their needs, circumstances, and values.

After looking at the picture and before reading anything about it, I noticed that the woman was wearing traditional African garb whereas the child was wearing a *Black is Beautiful* t-shirt printed in English, indicating two different cultures. Also, the child has a lighter skin color than the woman and does not closely resemble her. She might be his caretaker, although her self-assured, calm demeanor suggests that she might be his mother. They are looking in different directions, emphasizing their differing viewpoints and perhaps backgrounds. The woman is looking at the viewer, indicating awareness of the artist. The plants suggest a tropical locale, but the open sliding door suggests the absence of the insects I typically associate with a tropical locale. The woman seems to value serene calm. The child seems to value stimulation. The painting appears to include photographs on the plants or at least very elaborate patterns, obscure in nature. The painting appears to have been made on some sort of cloth, although I later found out that it is actually on paper. The patterns of the woman's dress appear to echo the patterns of the plants. The arrangement of the figures suggests the veranda of a tropical home.

So that's what I picked up by observation. I then investigated and found out many of things you have noted in your presentations. Still, I had been sitting in front of the painting for so long that it left an indelible impression that could not be erased by the extra knowledge I obtained through research. Perhaps I should have asked you to *only* observe the painting because, in most of your assignments, it seemed to get lost in comparison to the amount of attention you gave to the background and circumstances of the painting. I also think I should have assigned a hifi prototype so that a lot of you would have made design system choices, such as color palette, fonts, and grid layout.

One thing I noticed about the grading was that two groups who got Bs asked for the chance to redo the work. I never give that opportunity for reasons that you may be able to guess. Hint: when would the redo opportunity end? Why would anyone ever accept a grade below A under such a system? Would I have the opportunity to downgrade if I don't like the redo?

I do reconsider grades if I have missed something or made some other kind of error, but no redos. Well, I did once, when a person did a completely different assignment than the one assigned. It was an honest mistake, I'm sure, so I made an exception. But I don't make exceptions just because you're dissatisfied with your grade. I try to use grading as a lever to get you to think more about your work, anyway. It's not much of a lever if you basically choose your grade, which is what redos allow.

I didn't see much of the painting in most of your work, by the way. There was a lot of focus on African culture but that is only part of the story.

Again I ask, what did you think about this design challenge?

# Story Mapping

---

![](fiPatton2014cover.png){fig-alt="Cover of Jeff Patton's 2014 book, User Story Mapping, depicting a bird"}

::: {.notes}
The bird on the cover of Jeff Patton's book, *User Story Mapping*, @Patton2014a, is a lilac-breasted roller.

You should certainly read at least the *Read this first* chapter, followed by chapters 1 and 2. I'm just going to show you some pictures of story maps and give you some pointers on features they may share. Throughout this, bear in mind that the story map is not an outcome, but a prop in your conversation leading to a shared understanding of how your prototype will look.

## A basic story map

![](fiBasicStoryMap.png){fig-alt="People stand in front of a story map, a series of steps with details underneath"}

## Giving instructions doesn't always go well

![](fiCakeWrecks1.png){fig-alt="A cake decorated with the actual instructions to decorate the cake"}

## Here are some instructions

Customer: Hello, I’d like to order a cake.

Employee: Sure, what would you like written on it?

Customer: Could you write "So long, Alicia" in purple?

Employee: Sure.

Customer: And put stars around it?

Employee: No problem. I’ve written this up, and will hand it to my
cake decorator right away. We’ll have it for you in the morning.

## And here is the result

![](fiCakeWrecks2.png){fig-alt="A cake decorated with the instructions instead of the result of the instructions"}

## We need some way to get on the same page

![](fiWeAllAgree.png){fig-alt="A cartoon depicts people with different ideas converging after blackboarding"}

## A productive conversation with supporting artifacts

![](fiConversationPlusArtifacts.png){fig-alt="A conversation where people share an idea and have notes and pictures on the wall, supporting the conversation"}

## A basic change-the-world model

![](fiChangeTheWorld1.png){fig-alt="Patton's diagram of current state and outcome state"}

## A more refined change-the-world model

![](fiChangeTheWorld2.png){fig-alt="Patton's refined diagram of current state and outcome state"}

## A yet more refined change-the-world model

![](fiChangeTheWorld3.png){fig-alt="Patton's more refined diagram of current state and outcome state"}

## An early story map by the author and a collaborator

![](fiEarlyStoryMap1.png){fig-alt="A person kneels on the floor behind an enormous number of post-its, arranged in rows and columns"}

## Flow of the early story map
![](fiEarlyStoryMap2.png){fig-alt="Same photo as before but annotated with story flow from left to right"}

## One branch of the early story map

THINK - WRITE - EXPLAIN - PLACE
:::

::: {.notes}
As you develop the story map, you will THINK of things to add. When you THINK of something, immediately WRITE it down before explaining it to the others. Then EXPLAIN it, then place your written artifact (probably a post-it) on the map.

## Another story map
![](fiAnotherStoryMap.png){fig-alt="A story map depicting different users at different stages"}

## Organizing details into three product release slices
![](fiReleaseSlices.png){fig-alt="Two designers organize detail post-its into three layers corresponding to three product releases"}

## Story maps support a conversation that builds shared understanding
- The map is a prop, not an outcome
- Maximize outcomes, minimize output
- Prioritize outcomes, not features
