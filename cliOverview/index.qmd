# Genesis

:::: {.incremental}
- started as a hallway convo with James, Elliott, and Abhijit
- we all need to teach some *[commandlinefu]{.emph}*
- we reinvent each other's lectures too often
- why not develop a set of reusable modules?
- why not apply for a teaching innovation grant (tig)?
::::

::: {.notes}
There is great value in hallway conversations!
:::

# Why CLI?
:::: {.incremental}
- GUIs limit your options
- GUIs don't leave an audit trail
- GUIs are often inaccessible
::::

# What's wrong with CLI?
:::: {.incremental}
- relies on memory
- relies on correct spelling
- may rely on arcane installation processes
::::

# tig
:::: {.incremental}
- provides some summer support
- this year, 10/50 projects funded at 3,000USD
- this project funded as *Welcome to the Command Line! Inclusive technical open educational resources*
- what does *inclusive* mean? What does *open educational* mean?
::::

# inclusive
:::: {.incremental}
- user testing on underrepresented groups
- using html and markdown so blind students have a fighting chance of accessing it
- applying Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to development, e.g., @Fovet2021, @Gargiulo2022, @Jung2023
::::

# open educational resources
:::: {.incremental}
- varying definitions of it, e.g., @Wiley2014
- license (most popular is MIT)
- availability (as a github repo)
- flexibility (to use what you want)
::::

# Design for social acceptance
