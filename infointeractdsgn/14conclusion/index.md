Week FOURTEEN

# Final Presentations
The final project is not due yet, but present your work in progress prototype to the class, first giving a brief introduction to your project as a whole. This is a good opportunity for feedback before you turn in your final deliverable.

# Course Evaluations
Please take a few minutes of class time to do course evaluations. These mean a lot to me!

# Microinteractions
Let's review a few of the microinteraction examples that we didn't have a chance to see after last week's exercise.

# Final Exam
Let's briefly look at the final exam file.

# Conclusion
I hope you enjoyed this course and learned a lot, both in concepts and skills! Keep in touch!
