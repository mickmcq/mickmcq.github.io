How to Start
:::

---

::: {.r-fit-text}
Read the syllabus?
:::

(eventually we'll hafta)

---

::: {.r-fit-text}
Go around the room saying our names?
:::

(eventually we'll hafta)

---

::: {.r-fit-text}
Get the juices flowing!

---

WHY?
:::

---

I think it's better to start with an exercise that reminds of what we do, no matter how proficient we are at it.

I need to know something about you and this is a very revealing exercise.

::: {.notes}
What the heck does that mean? (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test)
:::

---

- Empathize
- Define
- Ideate
- Prototype
- Test

::: {.notes}
That's one view of the design thinking process. I'd like you to engage in that process today.

Now do what they did!
:::

---

::: {.r-fit-text}
Materials
:::

- three pages
- some index cards (about 6)
- some colored sharpies (at least 3)
- a pen or pencil

---

::: {.r-fit-text}
Form Groups
:::

- first form a pair with someone like you
- then form a group of four with a pair that identifies differently from you (gender, ethnicity, or other identity factors)
- this gives you support (pair) and diversity (group of four)

---

::: {.r-fit-text}
Protocol
:::

- Empathize (interview)
- Define (list of needs)
- Ideate (storyboard sheet)
- Prototype (cards)

---

::: {.r-fit-text}
‹interview›
:::

- break into pairs so everyone gets a chance to be interviewer and interviewee
- interview is about supporting new year's resolutions
- if you're a trio go 2-on-1 or 1-on-2 either way

---

::: {.r-fit-text}
‹make a list of needs›
:::

- analyze the interview
- be sure to think about what they meant, not just what they said
- think about how you could have gotten more from the interview

---

::: {.r-fit-text}
‹storyboard›
:::

- draw four panels of cartoons on the ideate page
- show a successful interaction with an app
- don't worry about the app details
- concentrate on the user experience &mdash; what did the user feel?

---

::: {.r-fit-text}
‹prototype›
:::

- now use the index cards
- draw a few main app screens
- focus on making it easy for the user
- think about the circumstances of use

---

## test
- we're skipping the test phase due to time constraints
- but keep your cards so you can test later
- it's never too early to test
- but testing is the focus of a different course

## our focus

::: {.r-fit-text}
what did we learn?
:::

- give me your insights about each phase and write them in your sketchbook
- phases were
  - empathize (interview)
  - define (list)
  - ideate (storyboard)
  - prototype (cards)
