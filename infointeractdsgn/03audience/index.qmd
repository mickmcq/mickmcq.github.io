# Crazy Eights

## Annotated! And speedy!

![](fiCrazyEights1.png)

::: {.notes}
This example included not only after the fact annotation but a lot of additional frames in the time it took most students to complete one page. Ordinarily I don't preach annotations but I think that, if you have extra time, it helps to document your work. Speed is the priority, though, always.

## Easy to understand at a glance

::: {.notes}
On the other hand, here's one that needs no annotation. We can easily understand it at a glance.
:::

## Pencil or not?

![](fiCrazyEights3.jpg)

::: {.notes}
I originally encouraged starting with pencil and going over it, but now I think it's better to just start with Sharpie and make erasure impossible. If you run into trouble that requires erasure, just start over on a new page. This attitude change arises from the notion that speed is the highest priority in this exercise.

# Audience

## Academic Communities

- Human Factors in Schools of Engineering
- Human Computer Interaction in Schools of Computer Science & in iSchools
- Management Information Systems in Schools of Business

::: {.notes}
The topic has been studied by three main academic
communities, human factors in schools of engineering, human
computer interaction in computer science schools, and
management information systems in b-schools.
Each of the three has specialized to some extent but
there are overlaps.
:::

## Human Factors
- People operating complex machines
  - automobiles
  - ships
  - planes
  - nuclear reactors
- Reaction time
- Situational awareness
- Split-second decision making

::: {.notes}
*Human factors* is usually the experimental study of how
people operate complex machines like automobiles, ships,
nuclear reactors, and aircraft. Since the researchers
who identify themselves this way are usually funded by
the military, they emphasize military applications
although their findings are usually applicable to some
degree outside the military.
:::

## Human Computer Interaction
- Evolved from ideal user to communities
- Started by cognitive psychologists
- First home was in computer science

::: {.notes}
*Human computer interaction* was, until recently,
primarily the study of one person
interacting with one computer system. This field began
with the study of users of expensive computers
performing specialized work tasks. At this time,
researchers mainly studied how the user interface affected
some measure of productivity, usually in laboratory
studies. The second period of human
computer interaction research studied how people
interact casually with computers. This involved field
studies with very small groups of participants (formerly
called users) and very limited conclusions, appropriate
to the increased pace of change in user interfaces.
:::

## Management Information Systems
- Adoption of technological innovation
- Diffusion of technological innovation
- Always in productive organization context
- Concerned with management of technology

::: {.notes}
*Management Information Systems* is professed in some
business schools, and has long been concerned with the adoption and
diffusion of technological innovation in productive
organizations. This concern has led to many psychological
studies of groups of users of information systems in
organizations.
:::

## Epochs in Human Computer Interaction

- The idealized individual
- The casual individual
- Workgroups
- Ubiquitous Computing
- Communities of Practice
- Communities of Place

::: {.notes}
It's easier to identify past epochs than current ones.
It appears that human computer interaction has diverged
into two areas in the current era but the distinction is
harder to be certain of without the advantage of years
of hindsight. The two current branches appear to be
*ubiquitous computing* and *computing communities*.

*Ubiquitous computing* is an old term referring to computers
embedded in other devices and able to communicate with each
other. When first coined by Marc Weiser around 1991 (see
@Weiser1991), the term meant anything that was not a desktop
computer and concerned a small, well-defined community. Today,
almost no interaction between computers and people can be
defined with respect to only a desktop computer, rendering the
original definition moot. Now it seems to encompass all
computing.

*Community computing* is not a broadly used term by
itself. I am using it here to refer to the change in focus
from a single person (formerly a user) to many people
forming a community. Two types of communities exist,
communities that occur in computer networks and
communities that exist in the physical world. Since the
latter may share sewers, electrical utilities,
telecommunications utilities, roads, schools, local
governments, and other aspects of physical
infrastructure, it differs greatly from a network-only
community such as Facebook.

Communities that can function remotely, such as
Facebook, are the focus of study of Social Network
Analysis and Data Science, closely related fields whose
work is enabled by monitoring electronic communication
networks.

Communities that exist in physical space, such as
neighborhoods and cities, are obviously the subject of
study of architects, social workers, and people in many
other disciplines. Recently, many of these researchers
and their sponsors have aligned with computer scientists
identified with human computer interaction.

Note that the above bifurcation is a matter of opinion. Many different perspectives exist about how to divide the academic community, such as the tracks of CHI. Most of the perspectives that I (Mick) have encountered divide the community into a very large number of segments. You should develop your own perspective with exposure to the community.
:::

## Industrial and Government Communities

*You want me to deprioritize
my current reports until you advise
of a status upgrade?*

*Make these your primary
action items.*

::: {style="text-align: right;"}
&mdash; dialog from *Fight Club*, 1999
:::

::: {.notes}
That's dialog from *Fight Club* (1999), a film which highlights the dystopian features of business and a violent reaction to them.

The business world has its own language of businessspeak, as we see in this quote from *Fight Club*. It is difficult for academics to understand and convey the meaning behind this strange language. But we try.
:::

## Suppliers of IT

Who are suppliers of IT today? How do you measure? Public awareness? Market Capitalization? What industry codes are applicable?

::: {.notes}
The most influential suppliers are those with interface guidelines for public-facing apps that you may choose to follow or reject: Google, Apple, Microsoft. But there is a wide world outside Silicon Valley as well, so it makes sense to think about suppliers in broader terms. Even within Silicon Valley there are CRM and ERP vendors who determine interaction guidelines for large swaths of b2b computing yet receive little public attention.
:::

## Customers of IT

This group can best be defined by students.

## Historical perspective, revisited
- idealized user
- casual user
- workgroup
- groups in general
- ambient computing

::: {.notes}
A historical perspective might divide the study of HCI into several periods. The first period could be characterized by costly computers, nondiscretionary users, and the struggle to improve the speed and quality of productive output of computing, led by Herbert Simon and Allan Newell at Carnegie-Mellon. The second period could be characterized by a focus on human concerns, discretionary use and better adapting the computer to suit an imperfect person. The third period could be characterized by a focus on workgroups, groups in general, and computing within human activities where computers may not be the focus. Finally, the current period could be characterized by a focus on communities of place and the role of computing in the fabric of everyday life.
:::

## Idealized user
::: {.container}
:::: {.col}
The idealized user was studied intensively by Herbert Simon and his associates at Carnegie-Mellon. They broke tasks into very small components and investigated the state of mind of users at every moment.
::::
:::: {.col}
![](fiBabyBubblehead.png){width=70%}

:::

::: {.notes}
On the right, you see a figure from one of their publications which has come to be called *Baby Bubblehead* and which represents the idealized user. Notice that *Baby Bubblehead* is pushing a button and this action is associated with timed cognitive processes that can be examined minutely.
:::

## Nondiscretionary use
- Labor was cheap
- Machines were expensive
- Therefore, make labor more efficient

::: {.notes}
When computers were individually expensive, HCI professionals, like others, were focused on making the best use of the very expensive time of these machines. They sought to understand how and why time was wasted and what would be needed to waste less of it. For example, the IBM subsecond study found that people would lose their train of thought if the computer took more than roughly a second to respond to keystrokes. This led to the purchase of faster IBM computers but also had some positive effects.
:::

## Hierarchical collaboration
- 1980s
- Most HCI work funded by DoD
- Collaborating in rigidly defined hierarchies

::: {.notes}
During the 1980s, most academic HCI research was funded by the US Department of Defense. That organization was interested in using computers to collaborate within and across rigidly defined organizational hierarchies. Some HCI research during this period found that known organizational psychology phenomena could be instantiated in software to achieve desired group dynamics.
:::

## Workgroup cooperation
- Partly a reaction to DoD-funded research
- Partly a generalization
- Workgroups without a rigid hierarchy

::: {.notes}
The rise of networked computers in the 1980s and nineties led to a community of HCI researchers, coalesced around the Computer-Supported Cooperative Work conference, seeking answers to questions about groups of computer users without a specific hierarchical arrangement.
:::

## Discretionary computing
::: {.container}
:::: {.col}
- Games
- Non-workplace activities
- Driven by falling price of computers
::::
:::: {.col}
![](fiDoom.png){width=70%}
::::
:::

::: {.notes}
On the right is an advertising image for Doom, certainly the most important game in computing history. At one time, any device was defined as a general-purpose computer by many if it could play Doom.

As the price of computers has fallen, more and more HCI work has been focused on discretionary use of computers. This includes studies of games and other recreational, non-workplace activities.

Note that, although the price of an individual computer has fallen, their ubiquity has led to computing occupying a greater share of the cost of modern products. This fact was highlighted to me years ago when Mercedes claimed that three fifths of the cost of their very expensive cars was software.
:::

## Ubiquitous computing
- Mark Weiser's famous article coined the term
- Raised awareness that cheap computers everywhere were the future
- Principles:
  - The purpose of a computer is to help you do something else.
  - The best computer is a quiet, invisible servant.
  - The more you can do by intuition the smarter you are; the computer should extend your unconscious.
  - Technology should create calm.

::: {.notes}
The term *ubiquitous computing* was coined over 25 years ago by a visionary named Mark Weiser. Unfortunately, Weiser died at a young age and the notion of ubiquitous computing floundered for a time. Nevertheless there has been a small stream of research on this topic since about 1991.
:::

## Communities of Practice
- E.g., radiologists adopting new technology
- Requires extensive knowledge of each discipline

::: {.notes}
Communities of practice were studied at the dawn of HCI within the study of nondiscretionary use of computing. By far the most famous study of a community of practice was the study by Barley of radiologists and their adoption of new technology. Elsewhere I have mentioned that Barley acquired an M.D. in the course of this, one of the most extensive ethnographic studies related to information technology.
:::

## Communities of Life

::: {.container}
:::: {.col}
Community development, such as preached by Saul Alinsky, precedes the HCI community's interest.
::::
:::: {.col}
![](fiRulesForRadicals.jpg){width=70%}
::::
:::

::: {.notes}
To distinguish between communities of practice and
communities of life, let's consider the phenomenon of
community development which gained a higher media profile
when a community organizer was elected President of the USA
in 2008. Community development was again highlighted when a
presidential candidate in 2012 claimed to have had a *real*
job in contrast to the President's job as a community
organizer. Of course, mainstream media presents a
confused picture of community organizers as socialists,
terrorists, and even vegans.

A clearer picture of community development comes from
speaking directly with community organizers, who can be
found throughout the USA, especially in areas impacted by
poverty. I (Mick) have been privileged to speak with a few
and, although I have not read much of their literature, I am
confident in describing one aspect of community development.

## Communities and infrastructure
- housing
- health care facilities
- quality of air and water
- postal and shipping services
- roads
- other transportation facilities
- schools
- utilities
- waste removal
- sewage
- watershed maintenance

::: {.notes}
Communities are complicated, fragile entities. They depend
on investment from businesses and the presence of productive
enterprise. A number of factors can drive businesses away
from a community and, when any of these factors appears,
others are likely to follow. Collectively, we can call most
of these factors deficiencies in infrastructure.
Infrastructure includes
housing,
health care facilities,
quality of air and water,
postal and shipping services,
roads,
other transportation facilities,
schools,
utilities,
waste removal,
sewage,
watershed maintenance,
and probably several others.

The one thing I have omitted from the above list is people.
Specifically, a community must have a high proportion of its
members in the workforce, meaning that a high proportion of
its members must be of an age, 18--65, to be eligible for
the workforce. Children and the elderly need care and, if a
community consists mainly of members in these age groups,
who will care for them?

If any of the above infrastructure elements is missing, the
others are threatened. Working age parents will often refuse
to settle in otherwise attractive communities that lack
highly-rated schools. Businesses can not meet their
schedules in a community suffering frequent brownouts or
blackouts.
:::

## Community organizers
::: {.container}
:::: {.col}
- Work at a very small scale
- Are rarely successful at bringing families out of poverty
- Suffer from stovepiping
::::
:::: {.col}
![](fiPresidentObama.jpg){width=70%}
::::
:::

::: {.notes}
At the right, we see one community organizer who became very successful.

Community organizers are typically not very successful. One
community organizer told me that, if she could help a single
family out of poverty, she would consider it an important
and infrequent accomplishment. If she could help a dozen
families out of poverty, she would have a successful career.
These are dauntingly small numbers.

Most efforts at community development suffer from a
phenomenon named just like a somewhat similar problem in
information technology, stovepiping. This means that any
single initiative tackles one of the above infrastructure
problems. The results are usually irrelevant to the health
of the community as a whole because
the complicated, interdependent relationships between the
people and the infrastructure elements are more sensitive to
damage than to repair. A substantial number of elements must
be improved to support any given individual element.

It is very difficult to avoid stovepiping in community
development as it is information technology. People usually
have expertise in one domain, access to resources in one
domain, and a mandate in one domain.
:::

## Upskilling as a community solution
- Risks depleting the community of employment age individuals
- Attracts industries that may not help the community

::: {.notes}
As an example, many community development efforts focus on
improving skills of individuals to make them more
employable.
One problem with the jobs/skills approach is that historically it has
actually weakened poverty-challenged communities, since programs like
this are used by the brightest and fastest learners as an exit
strategy from the community. One big challenge is how to add skills
without creating an exodus from the community. There is no easy answer, but
the jobs / skills focus might help if the skills have an immediate local
application. The problem is that to keep the newly skilled you have to
add roads, housing, sewers, fast internet access, cell-phone towers, and
everything else that businesses need to move into the area and employ
people locally.

One horrible example in my (Mick's) experience is Tucson, AZ, which made the decision a long time ago to attract "call centers" that semi-retired military people there could work for part-time. These call centers became the biggest private industry in Tucson and they don't train anybody to do much of anything, and they feature high turnover and low wages.  Seniority is a problem for management because of demands for increasing wages with experience, so they routinely lay off the more experienced workers seasonally and bring them back with a new clock the following year.
:::

## Communities of place and HCI
- HCI history
- HCI has made a conscious decision to try to make a difference to communities
- High-profile HCI projects have struggled to make a difference to communities

::: {.notes}
All of the foregoing leads to a definition of communities of
life as depending on a fragile, complicated network of
physical infrastructure and working-age people for health.
Notice that this is a normative definition of community. You
may feel that it has delved too deeply into details for a
course in human computer interaction. I assure you that, if
anything, it does not provide enough details. The community
of practice known as HCI has made a conscious and long-term
decision throughout the past two decades to try to make a
difference to communities of life. All too often, these
efforts have led nowhere because of an inadequate
appreciation of the details of challenges faced by communities
of life. Many high-profile HCI projects have struggled
for this reason and a few have enjoyed success. I'll list
a few examples.

(1) A project in Kenya involving HCI students from Michigan
was concerned with the uncertainty faced by small farmers
selling milk at a distant market. Picture this: A small
farmer trudges down a dusty road with a single animal laden
with a couple of barrels of milk. Pretty soon, he is met by
a man in distress. Through his tears, the man explains that
the bottom has dropped out of the milk market from which he
is returning and that he was forced to sell his milk as well
as his only animal for almost nothing. He shows the farmer a
pittance in his gnarled hand and walks on. Now the farmer is
shaken and, before the piteous cries of the man have died
away, he meets a jolly yokel. The yokel says that he is
thinking about dairy farming and wants to buy an animal and
some milk with the all the money he has saved. That amount
turns out to be considerably less than the farmer had hoped
for at market, but more than pitiful man had claimed to
receive. So the farmer takes the small price and considers
himself lucky, unsure whether he has been bilked by a pair
of con men or has narrowly averted disaster.

The project realized that anyone could get a cell phone in
this region and that even the poorest of the farmers had
one. It was a small step from there to setting up a dial-in
service (no, there was no wifi in this rural district) that
texts the current market price of milk to a caller on even
the most primitive cell phone. The farmer need not even be
literate to take advantage of this system, just numerate.

(2) A Ph.D. student in HCI at Stanford was funded to do a
project with free cell phones in a rural district in India.
She was herself Indian in origin, although she was operating
in a completely unfamiliar state. These phones, running the
old Symbian operating system, could support $240\times160$
video. Her plan was to provide health education to
illiterate pregnant women using the videos. She even
persuaded local officials of a rank of approximately mayor (I
don't know the correct term) to record videos endorsing her
project.

The project was a resounding failure because she did not
understand household relations. The
husband's mother typically lived with the family and was the final
authority on health care for the pregnant wife. By bypassing
the mother-in-law and going directly to the pregnant woman,
she believed she was appealing to a new generation more open
to contemporary health practices. Instead, she was
threatening the dominion of the mother-in-law, whose
authority in the household kept her clothed and fed in a
society that offered her no alternative. The mothers-in-law,
feeling threatened with displacement,
proved to be dedicated, relentless foes of the project, no
matter the health benefits.

By the time the Ph.D.~student came to understand the
dynamic, the funding had dried up, preventing her from
trying in a different rural community where she could make
the mothers-in-law the focal point of the plan.

(3) Also in India, a well-known HCI scholar (from Berkeley?)
devised a microfinance system around a series of paper forms
with QR codes, a cell phone for each village, a tiny wooden
platform for aiming the phone at the papers, a single
printer serving many villages, and the Indian postal system
to deliver the printed forms. This initiative brought
together a small group of women in each village who would
collectively save money and decide on small purchases. It
took advantage of the presence of the postal
system to overcome the issue of printing forms and used QR
codes as an information storage and transmission system,
enabled by the ubiquitous give-away phones running Symbian,
an operating system too primitive to appeal to first-world
consumers. The developer used the phone and wooden platform as
an excuse to bring the group together to converse and make
financial decisions, knowing that these meetings might have the
potential to serve other purposes.

(4) Finally, an Indian example I had the misfortune to
witness was a CHI design competition where an Indian student
had devised a hardware / software platform to assist bus
conductors in a rural state. This was a small tablet-like
device that would be carried by the conductor who would
talk to the passengers to learn their destinations and enter
them into the device, and be able to shout out stops to the
driver at appropriate times. It was a complicated
bottlenecky system. To
show the audience that there were conductors on buses and
that crowding on buses made it difficult to communicate
stops, he showed many slides to
illustrate. When someone asked why not let
passengers communicate with their cell phones and remove the
bottleneck, he explained that rural Indians were too poor to
afford cell phones, a claim contradicted by dozens of the
people pictured in his slides! He was also an example of a
person who would not let his teammates speak, preferring to
control the entire presentation and question-answer session.
I have to think that he needed to acquire more sensitivity to the
population he was trying to serve as well as to the
colleagues with whom he was trying to do important work.

An observant student pointed out that @Irani2010 describes a similar incident in rural India where HCI professionals tried to improve the lives of poverty-stricken people with water quality problems. When they could not find poverty-stricken people with water problems (!), they took their pre-existing solution to these problems elsewhere. @Irani2010 tells a few such stories of postcolonial computing in this fascinating paper. @Merritt2011 offers theoretical support for thinking about HCI4D.

To summarize, communities of life can be served by HCI, but
not without seeking some understanding of complicated
fragile networks of infrastructure that account for so much
of the variation in health between communities.

## Disability-specific design
UT-Austin is notable as a disability-friendly campus, according to [https://www.collegeconsensus.com/rankings/best-disability-friendly-colleges/](https://www.collegeconsensus.com/rankings/best-disability-friendly-colleges/)

::: {.notes}
Although this introductory course does not introduce accessibility, you should be introduced to some of the terms and literature in this community.
:::

## Approaches to disability-specific design
@Shinohara2016 identified four different approaches to disability-specific design and listed some of the research in each approach, which I will repeat here:

- universal design: @Bigelow2012, @Mace1991
- user-sensitive inclusive design: @Newell2000, @Newell2011
- design for user empowerment: @Ladner2015
- ability-based design: @Wobbrock2011

## Other design approaches of note
- value-sensitive design: @Friedman1996
- design for social acceptance: @Shinohara2012

::: {.notes}
You should investigate the above-listed resources to prepare for studies in accessibility and design.

# Popularization via bad design
@Norman2013 popularized the identification of bad design in its first edition in the eighties.

::: {.notes}
Don Norman is the single person who has done the most to popularize HCI in the public consciousness. He is a brilliant thinker and I don't mean to criticize him for this, but one thing he did that brought him amazing popularity yet did little to educate people was to popularize the discussion of poor design. His most popular book is fraught with examples of bad design and it is inevitable that any teacher of HCI can boost course evals by allowing students to waste a lot of time critiquing bad design. The problem with this is that it is so hard to get design right that noticing that much of it is poor is, by itself, a minute step.

Most bad design examples remind us of the importance of signifiers and the danger of cognitive dissonance.

- that aspect of a thing you can interact with that
suggests how to interact with it
- can be done well or poorly
- central concept for individual user
- often skeuomorphic
- flat design opposes notion of need for signifiers
